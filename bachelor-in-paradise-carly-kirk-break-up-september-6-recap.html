With that, she left to get back to her daughter.&nbsp;And then there was&nbsp;Ashley and Jared. He agreed to spend the night in the fantasy suite,&nbsp;and she seemed pretty open to losing her virginity to Jared; while we never got a straight answer if they did or <i>didn’t</i> sleep together, it seemed like a no.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Afterward, he pulled her aside the next night, and told her that he wasn’t&nbsp;feeling He actually left right then, and (no surprise here)&nbsp;she was a mess. However, through tears, she said to him, “Thank you for making me realize that the total package exists.” I mean, if there’s a sweeter compliment out there, I haven’t heard it.</p><h3>You Lose Some, You Win Some</h3><p id=content-paragraph-4>Meanwhile, Jaclyn chose Justin for her date. However, the newcomer arrived right after:&nbsp;<strong>Cassandra</strong> (from <strong>Juan Pablo</strong>‘s season) stole Justin’s eye right away. Plus, they’re both single parents. So when she asked him on her date, he admitted he was more attracted to her that Jaclyn, so he pretty much told Jaclyn JK about their date. With that, Jaclyn gave her date card to Nick (after he literally rolled around in the sand) so that he could ask out Samantha.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Cassandra and Justin totally connected on their date and basically&nbsp;found in one date, what everyone spent the summer&nbsp;looking for, and it seemed like Samantha and Nick did as well — but who knows&nbsp;with Sam right? Carly put it best:</p><h3>And The Rose Goes To…</h3><p id=content-paragraph-6>As for a cocktail hour, well, it was canceled by <strong>Chris Harrison</strong>.&nbsp;Right before the rose ceremony, Ashley I. told everyone that&nbsp;she&nbsp;was going to head home, and that she would live by&nbsp;Tenley’s “whimsical attachment” — which means you find someone with all the qualities you want, but it doesn’t work. However, it does teach you what you want in someone, which will help you in the future. She knew that her heart was still completely broken by&nbsp;Jared,&nbsp;so out she went.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Heading into the rose ceremony,&nbsp;the men were instructed to only give roses to women who they could see a serious relationship with.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Kirk chose Carly<br>Tanner chose Jade<br>Nick chose Samantha<br>Joshua chose Tenley<br>Justin chose Cassandra<br>Dan chose&nbsp;not to give his rose to anyone, since he didn’t find love. (RESPECT!)<br>Mikey chose Mackenzie, to try and get to know her —&nbsp;but she told him&nbsp;there was nothing there and left. So, out he went as well.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>If you’re counting,&nbsp;Jaclyn, Ashley S., Mackenzie, Chelsie, Amber, Mikey, and Dan all went home at the rose ceremony. Ashley I., Jared, and Juelia went home before. Yes, that’s ten people.</p><h3>Just When You Thought You Were Happy</h3><p id=content-paragraph-10>Chris Harrison showed up, again, after the rose ceremony to tell the final five couples to ask the tough questions about what was next. He sent each couple on a one-on-one date and a fantasy suite.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>Everyone was THRILLED — except Kirk, who dropped a bomb on Carly: he had been going through the motions for the last couple of days, and wasn’t in the same place as she was. Yes this was right after she told him he “was her person.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>After watching so many seasons of this, Kirk’s conversation with Carly may be the most painful one&nbsp;I’ve ever seen. You guys, I got emotional. You could seriously feel her pain, and clearly Jade could, too — she was crying for her friend, too! And with that, Carly did not want to hear any more, so she went home, and Kirk did, too.</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>In case you were counting, that’s a total of&nbsp;twelve people eliminated in one night. That’s got to be some sort of record. What do you think of Kirk’s decision,&nbsp;<strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>?</p><p id=content-paragraph-14><strong>— Emily Longeretta</strong><br><a class=twitter-follow-button href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Follow @emilylongeretta</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWllZH16e49vZpuZk52yrbvRZqCnZaCWv6KwyKycZpuRp7m6ecqiqaRlkqeyoreMrqdmq5Wlwaa5wZ6pZm5dp7Kkrc9o</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbachelor-in-paradise-carly-kirk-break-up-september-6-recap.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbachelor-in-paradise-carly-kirk-break-up-september-6-recap.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbachelor-in-paradise-carly-kirk-break-up-september-6-recap.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbachelor-in-paradise-carly-kirk-break-up-september-6-recap.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbachelor-in-paradise-carly-kirk-break-up-september-6-recap.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbachelor-in-paradise-carly-kirk-break-up-september-6-recap.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./dan-levy-vs-annie-murphy-which-schitts-creek-star-has-the-higher-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./dan-levy-vs-annie-murphy-which-schitts-creek-star-has-the-higher-net-worth.html>Dan Levy Vs.

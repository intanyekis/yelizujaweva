<time>29 Jul 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Not many people gain fame by unconventional methods but only a few&nbsp;people gain fame and are able to give back to the world. <strong>Kevin Wu</strong> is one of those people few who survived a major accident and somehow&nbsp;became even better on the other side of the tunnel.</p><p>Kevin Wu is a youtube star, an activist and humanitarian who is known for being an early Youtube comedian. In fact, people know him by his youtube username <strong>KevJumba</strong>. Today, here we are going to explore his net worth, income, affairs, girlfriends and facts. So, let’s dig in.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_Is_The_Net_Worth_Of_Kevjumba></span>What Is The Net Worth Of Kevjumba?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>As of 2019, Kevjumba has a handsome amount of net worth of <strong>$2 million</strong>. He accumulated this hefty amount of money through his youtube channel which amassed a following of 350+ million total views. Kevin also played a starring role in some movies like Revenge of Green Dragon, Hang Loose, and Man up.</p><p>His Revenge co-star <strong>Justin Chon</strong> believes that Kev has everything that he needs to be a star.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecelebscloset.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/KevJumba-2.jpg><p>The Youtuber also used to make a monthly earning of <strong>$23 thousand</strong>&nbsp;to <strong>$400 thousand</strong>&nbsp;and annually <strong>$200 thousand</strong>&nbsp;to <strong>$2</strong> <strong>million</strong> through his youtube channel.</p><p>Wu’s talent earned him over five figures for just three minute videos in addition with his YouTube revenue and tours and movies of all sort.&nbsp;</p><p>However, Kevin completely stopped making videos for his channel and is currently working as a philanthropist. Nevertheless, his channel, Kev, still has 2.8 million subscribers.</p><p>The man wanted to be more than just a YouTube. He always wanted to be like Donald Glover who pulled out of the YouTube platform before it could define him.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>I always knew that this internet popularity would maybe come and go. Maybe I got tired of watching myself talking into the camera – I didn’t see that format as something very sustainable.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Wu further reveals that the YouTube videos and the golden opportunities he was getting was only making his personal growth slow. He states that his personality became very dependent on his viewers thoughts.&nbsp;</p><p>Hence, he looked at both the materialistic and the spiritial views and “didn’t necessarily think one was better than the other.” He had plans of getting back to the audience but his plans were shattered following his accident. More on this below!</p><p>Kev is back now, or so it seems. The YouTuber, who had to go through an accident, appeared as a guest in <strong>NigaHiga</strong> YouTube Channel’s Off the Pill podcast.&nbsp;</p><p>Kevin is an animal&nbsp;enthusiast and owns a pet dog&nbsp;<strong>Jackie</strong> and expresses his love towards it by posting pictures.</p><h3>KevJumba’s Charities And Philanthropic Works</h3><p>Kevin is one celebrity who likes to help and donate to charity incessantly. Moreover, in 2008,&nbsp;he began a campaign Jumbafund through his youtube channel and he solely obtains funds for the needy people.</p><p>Wu donated thousands of dollars to several charitable organizations, where he also personally lends a helping hand by setting up basic schools in Kenya. He did all this with the intention to provide free and quality education to uneducated children.</p><p><strong>Read Also</strong><strong>:<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><span id=Youtuber_Logan_Paul_Dating_Affairs_And_Relationship class=ez-toc-section> Youtuber Logan&nbsp;Paul’ Dating Affairs And Relationship</span></a></strong></p><p>Furthermore, he also initiated a tour starting a comical musical program to create awareness against Hepatitis B.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=KevJumba%E2%80%99s_Relationship_Personal_Life_And_Accident></span>KevJumba’s Relationship, Personal Life And Accident<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Kevin is a very private person and maintains a distance with media as much as possible.

Who will he play with? Who will he lean on in times of trouble? But while it is true that having a sibling can be wonderful – in some cases it’s truly like having a best friend whom you’re related to by blood – numerous examples show that siblings often don’t get along. Indeed, very often having a sibling is more trouble than being an only child.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Just because you’re related to someone by blood doesn’t mean that you will necessarily get along. Family is, in most cases, wonderful, but that doesn’t mean that family members and siblings are necessarily your friends. Jealousy and hatred is ripe everywhere and siblings are more often than not willing to stab their sibling in the back.</p><p>Don’t believe us? Then have a look at famous celebrity siblings. There are countless examples of celebrity siblings who are either bitterly feuding or who outright hate each other.</p><h2 id=alec-baldwin-and-stephen-baldwin>Alec Baldwin And Stephen Baldwin</h2><p>Both Alec Baldwin and Stephen Baldwin are actors but that seems to be all they have in common. You probably know Alec Baldwin from his roles in Beetlejuice, 30 Rock, To Rome with Love and Boss Baby (for which he lent his voice) and Stephen Baldwin from his roles in films such as The Usual Suspects and Born on the Fourth of July as well as his role on the TV show The Young Riders.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>The biggest difference between Alec and Stephen is their view on politics.</strong></p><p>Alec Baldwin is known for mocking&nbsp;the president on Saturday Night Live (SNL). Stephen on the other hand loves&nbsp;him and has heavily criticized his brother’s disrespectful parody of the President.</p><p>In&nbsp;a recent interview, Stephen has confessed that he has not spoken to Alec since election – “Early on during the campaign, I thought that SNL was getting a little too nasty. Now to be honest with you, I haven’t even spoken to my own brother since the election - So happy birthday, Alec! Love you!"</p><h2 id=jessica-simpson-and-ashlee-simpson>Jessica Simpson And Ashlee Simpson</h2><p>Jessica Simpson and Ashlee Simpson also don’t quite get along and seem to have little in common. They both started off their careers in the pop music industry but realized early on that the stage was not quite big enough for the two of them.</p><p><strong>Ashlee thus turned towards pop-punk and apparently mocked her sister in the song Shadow.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>You’d think that over the years their rivalry would have ceased but it seems that the sisters have a differing opinion on almost everything. For example, when Ashlee was pregnant Jessica decided to go on a two week trip to the island of St. Barthelemy to celebrate her birthday. Jessica also invited her mom on this trip even though Ashlee was about to go into labor any day.</p><p>In addition, Jessica apparently criticized Ashlee’s taste in nursery furniture– “Jessica criticized everything from the furniture to the baby clothes. Ashlee had decorated the nursery herself and she was very proud, and Jessica really hurt her feelings.”</p><h2 id=kendall-jenner-and-kylie-jenner>Kendall Jenner And Kylie Jenner</h2><p>Kendall Jenner and Kylie Jenner get on rather well in public but apparently can’t stand each other in private life. For siblings so close in age they have very differing opinions and according to Kylie’s best friend Jordyn Woods, that was always the case, even when they were children.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Kylie has said – “We have different opinions. We do everything differently. It's so interesting. 'I don’t think we’d be friends if we weren’t sisters.”</strong></p><p>Of course, if you’ve watched Keeping Up With The Kardashians you’re probably familiar with the tension between the two Kardashians. After all, they had quite a few fights on the show and Kendall has once even told Kourtney that she hates Kylie “so much sometimes.”</p><h2 id=liam-gallagher-and-noel-gallagher>Liam Gallagher And Noel Gallagher</h2><p>The brothers Liam Gallagher and Noel Gallagher may have been in the same rock band (Oasis) together, but they were certainly not on great terms. Both brothers threatened to leave the band for years and finally, when the band did break up in 2009 it was only two years later that Liam said that he’d rather eat his “own s**it than be in a band with him again.”</p><p><strong>Both brothers have confessed that they have hated each other since childhood.&nbsp;</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Liam has shared an example of their pure hatred towards each other by recounting how he once&nbsp;lay waste to his brother's stereo.</p><p>They brothers are feuding to this day and never miss a chance to criticize and make fun of one another either in interviews or on Twitter.</p><h2 id=rob-kardashian-and-kylie-jenner>Rob&nbsp;Kardashian&nbsp;And Kylie Jenner</h2><p>You’re probably not surprised to find Rob&nbsp;Kardashian and Kylie Jenner on this list. While it’s true that Rob seems to get on well with very few Kardashian clan members, him and Kylie seem to have a particular hatred towards each other.</p><p><strong>After all, who can forget that time in 2016 when Kylie posted a picture of a Satan-like figure known as Baphomet on her Instagram and likened it to Rob.</strong></p><p>No one knew the reason behind the masked insult but it didn’t take Kylie’s fans long to realize that Kylie was suspecting that Rob was dating Blac Chyna, the ex-girlfriend of Kylie’s then boyfriend Tyga. Kylie was of course right and it seems that Blac Chyna is the source of every argument that has occurred between Rob and Kylie since.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kim-richards-and-kyle-richards>Kim Richards And Kyle Richards</h2><p>The former child actress and TV personality Kim Richards can’t stand her sister and fellow actress and TV personality Kyle Richards. And the feeling is mutual. Their relationship has been a rocky one – over the years the sisters have argued, feuded, refused to talk to each other and then patched things up over and over again.</p><p><strong>But in a recent interview Kyle Richards revealed that it is hard not being able to share the struggles and life achievements with her sister.</strong></p><p>Kyle revealed that she has sold two more TV shows in addition to American Woman series but felt like she couldn’t share this huge milestone with Kim (or Kathy Hilton, for that matter)– “'I didn't know what their reaction would be and I didn't want to be let down by that. Because I don't have parents to share these things with, I thought just keep it to myself for now.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=beyonce-and-solange-knowles>Beyonce And Solange Knowles</h2><p>Solange Knowles may have scored a No. 1 album on Billboard 200&nbsp;chart last year, but to many she is still what she has always been – Beyonce’s little sister.</p><p><strong>There’s no denying that it’s difficult to be cast in the shadow of your bigger sister so it’s not surprising that the two sisters are not on the best of terms.</strong></p><p>The elevator incident – in which Solange was seen hitting Jay-Z while Beyonce stood to the side, watching silently and clearly taking no sides – has never been properly explained&nbsp;but the two sisters are trying their very best to portray a loving relationship to the rest of the world.</p><h2 id=kim-kardashian-and-rob-kardashian>Kim Kardashian And Rob Kardashian</h2><p>Kim has always been tough on Rob, especially when it came to his weight gain, so it’s not surprising that the two have never been on the best of terms. After all, who can forget that time in 2015 when Rob posted a photo of Amy from Gone Girl on his Instagram feed and captioned it as his sister.&nbsp;It didn’t take long for Kim to tweet an explanation –</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>“[Rob] thinks he’s being funny. I got mad at him and he posted that to get me back.”</strong></p><p>Later that year Kim got back at Rob in her own way, referencing his weight in a Rolling Stone interview.&nbsp;Fast forward to 2017, when Rob gifted Kim a pair of Gone Girl socks. Was he trying to reignite the feud or was he simply joking? No one was sure, but fans were freaking out at the possibility of another feud.</p><h2 id=the-jonas-brothers>The Jonas Brothers</h2><p>No one expected The Jonas Brothers to dissolve in 2013 so when that happened, the feel-good band’s fans were shook to the core. Apparently, while all seemed good on the outside, behind the scenes was rather different.</p><p><strong>According to the eldest brother Kevin, there was “friction” within the brothers.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kevin said – “We all had our strengths. focused on mine, which was kind of the business side of things and more about the touring and the creative... Nick was all about the music and Joe was about the entertainment aspect and the music. I think that’s just what made us stronger. But at the same time, it’s also what pulled it apart, which I think is inevitable when you’re working with your family for so long. Things happen.”</p><p>Moral of the story? Never work with family. Or if you do, know when to quit.</p><h2 id=dakota-fanning-and-elle-fanning>Dakota Fanning And Elle Fanning</h2><p>Both Dakota Fanning and Elle Fanning are doing great in Hollywood. Both are gorgeous actresses and both are successful. But that seems to be all they have in common. While they don’t actively hate each other, they don’t seem to be able to relate to one another like sisters should.</p><p><strong>Elle admitted that they have struggled with their relationship since their childhood – “When we were little we would fight all the time. I’m taller, so I would be the one beating her up.”</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Dakota also confessed in an interview that for a while they had nothing in common but their relationship is slowly getting better – “12 and 16 – we didn’t know what to do with each other. Now as she’s getting older and I’m getting older we’re getting closer… and that’s really lovely.”</p><h2 id=randy-jackson-and-jermaine-jackson>Randy Jackson And Jermaine Jackson</h2><p>It seems cliche but only too often hate stems from love, or rather, a love triangle. That's exactly what tore Jermaine Jackson and Randy Jackson apart.</p><p><strong>In 1986 Randy met a woman named Alejandra and while the two never married they ended up having two children. But Alejandra thought that Randy was a bit too immature and this is where Jermaine swooped in.</strong></p><p>The two ended up getting secretly married and went on to have children of their own. As you can probably imagine, Randy was quite upset and refused to speak to his brother.</p><h2 id=julia-roberts-and-eric-roberts>Julia Roberts And Eric Roberts</h2><p>The age gap between Julia Roberts and Eric Roberts is a significant one – 10 years – but once upon a time that didn’t stop them from being extremely close. However, their good relations changed when Eric got into substances.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>After he split up with Kelly Cunningham, with whom he had a daughter Emma Roberts, Julia took Kelly’s side and even made sure that she got custody of the child.</strong></p><p>However, it seems like brother and sister have finally re-united during their mother’s funeral in 2015 and Eric has said in a recent interview that their estrangement was all his fault – “I was exhausting to be around: complainy, blamey, unable to enjoy enjoyment. Everyone in my world needed a break sometimes, and that must have included Julia." Let's hope their renewed relationship lasts.</p><h2 id=madonna-and-christopher-ciccone>Madonna And Christopher Ciccone</h2><p>Once upon a time the Queen of Pop was very close to her brother Christopher Ciconne. Not only did they hang out on a regular basis, he also helped her at the very start of her career – he was her stylist and her assistant, among other things.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>That all changed when Ciccone wrote a book called Life With My Sister Madonna that contained sensitive information about Madonna and her life. As you can imagine, Madonna saw the book as a betrayal of her trust and cut all contact with her brother.</strong></p><p>They eventually patched things up but just last year Ciconne gave a spiteful interview in which he blamed his sister for his failure in Hollywood and threatened her with another exposing book.</p><h2 id=madonna-and-anthony-ciccone>Madonna And Anthony Ciccone</h2><p>Madonna comes from a large family – she has seven siblings – so it only makes sense that she doesn’t get along with all of them. Her sibling Christopher Ciccone is not the only sibling she is feuding with – Anthony Ciccone is another one.&nbsp;For years, Anthony was a homeless&nbsp;substance abuser but has recently been taken in by his family who hope that he will finally recover.</p><p><strong>Anthony has accused Madonna of neglecting him even though according to sources the Queen of Pop has paid for his rehab numerous times.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A few years ago Anthony said – “Madonna doesn't give a s-t if I'm dead or alive. She lives in her own world. I never loved her in the first place, she never loved me. We never loved each other." Now that Anthony is home, let's hope the two siblings are&nbsp;on better terms.</p><h2 id=emilio-estevez-and-charlie-sheen>Emilio Estevez And Charlie Sheen</h2><p>Emilio Estevez (best known for his role in the iconic film&nbsp;The Breakfast Club) and Charlie Sheen are both Hollywood regulars but their similar career paths have by no means resulted in a close relationship.</p><p><strong>Indeed, the two brothers seem to have a differing opinion on pretty much everything which stands in the way of&nbsp;their friendship.</strong></p><p>Charlie has always poked fun of Estevez while the latter remained tight-lipped. Estevez did however confess that he did not understand Sheen’s bad behavior and marveled at how his brother turned out so different to him seeing as they were brought up under the same roof with the same rules.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmqaegYrC2uNOuqZ5nYWp6pLHLnpmroaSuerS1waWgp5%2BjYsSpu4ycmKesXajBorrDZpyam5hivLW0xKtm</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f15-celebrity-siblings-who-cant-stand-each-other.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f15-celebrity-siblings-who-cant-stand-each-other.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f15-celebrity-siblings-who-cant-stand-each-other.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f15-celebrity-siblings-who-cant-stand-each-other.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f15-celebrity-siblings-who-cant-stand-each-other.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f15-celebrity-siblings-who-cant-stand-each-other.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./david-kushner-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./david-kushner-net-worth.html>David Kushner Net Worth How Much is David Kushner Worth?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./kieran-culkin-net-worth.html>Kieran Culkin Net Worth - KahawaTungu</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./kieran-culkin-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

With his departure opening up a spot at Firehouse 51, viewers have been wondering who will come on board next. Keep reading to find out <a href=# rel=noopener>who the new firefighter is on</a> Chicago Fire.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Chicago Fire</a> is NBC‚Äôs hit procedural that follows the professional and personal lives of the firefighters, rescue personnel, and paramedics at the Chicago Fire Department‚Äôs fictional Firehouse 51. Created by Dick Wolf, the series is the first installment of the One Chicago franchise, which includes the spinoffs <a href=# rel=noopener>Chicago P.D.</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Chicago Med</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>now-canceled&nbsp;Chicago Justice</a>. It first premiered in 2012 and is currently on its 12th season.</p><p>Season 12 has featured several casting shakeups, including the departures of <a href=# rel=noopener>Kara Killmer</a>, who starred as Sylvie Brett, and <a href=# rel=noopener>Alberto Rosende</a>, who portrayed Blake Gallo. At the beginning of the season,&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>The Bold and the Beautiful</a> alum Rome Flynn joined the cast as Derrick Gibson to fill the void that Gallo left behind. His time on the show was short-lived, however, and he exited after just six episodes, with his character leaving to focus on his mental health. Luckily, Truck 81 won‚Äôt be short-staffed for much longer, as a new firefighter has been cast for Season 12. Scroll on to learn more about the latest addition of the Chicago Fire cast.</p><h2>Who is the new firefighter on Chicago Fire?</h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Jack-Damon.jpg alt="Michael Bradway as Jack Damon Chicago Fire" width=1330 height=776 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Who is the new firefighter on Chicago Fire? Actor Michael Bradway will be coming on board in Season 12 as Firehouse 51‚Äôs newest recruit. He will portray a charming firefighter named Jack Damon and he‚Äôll make his debut in Episode 10, which airs on May 1.</p><p>Not much is known about the new character, but there is an option for Bradway to become a series regular next season. Along with Chicago Med and Chicago P.D., Chicago Fire already <a href=# rel=noopener>earned an early renewal by NBC</a> and will be getting a Season 13.</p><p>Bradway is relatively new to acting, but he‚Äôs set to star in the upcoming YA romance&nbsp;Marked Men&nbsp;from director&nbsp;Nick Cassavetes. The film is based on Jay Crownover‚Äôs best-selling novel Rule and it will also star Chase Stokes, Alexander Ludwig, Natalie Alyn Lind, Sydney Taylor and Paul Johansson, among others. His upcoming role on Chicago Fire will mark his television debut.</p><p>He celebrated landing the role on <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Instagram</a>, writing alongside a press release: ‚ÄúGot to be a part of the Chicago Fire Family for Season 12! üî•Can‚Äôt wait for you guys to see it next week!‚Äù In the comments section of Bradway‚Äôs post, one fan expressed her worry that the new firefighter might pose a threat to Stella Kidd (Miranda Rae Mayo) and Kelly Severide‚Äôs (Taylor Kinney) relationship, which has already been struggling for the past two seasons. ‚ÄúWell it says you are playing a charming firefighter and the next episode is going about Stellaride arguing about you. I hope to God that your character does not flirt with Stella. Otherwise, welcome to the show,‚Äù the fan wrote, to which Bradway responded: ‚ÄúMe too.‚Äù</p><p>News of Bradway‚Äôs casting comes shortly after Flynn, who originally replaced Rosende, exited the series during Episode 8. The actor opened up about his departure and short-lived stint on the show during a April 1 interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Variety</a>. ‚ÄúJust like all the fans, I was sad to see Gibson leave. He was a character I very much enjoyed playing,‚Äù he told the outlet after his final appearance. ‚ÄúI had a wonderful experience during my time on Chicago Fire&nbsp;and have great respect for the cast and crew and hope to team up with Dick Wolf again when the time is right.‚Äù</p><p>The casting change-up is also not the only one the show has faced this season. Killmer took her final bow as fan-favorite paramedic Sylvie Brett during Episode 6, leaving a spot open on Ambulance 61. Jared Lennox (played by Wesam Keesh) briefly filled her spot for two episodes, but was quickly fired for being insubordinate. In Episode 9, <a href=# rel=noopener>Lyla Novak</a> (Hallmark‚Äôs Jocelyn Hudon) joined Violet Mikami (Hanako Greensmith) on the ambulance, and so far, she seems like a great fit.</p><p>With all of the cast shakeups the show has undergone this season, including Severide‚Äôs <a href=# rel=noopener>on-off status at 51</a>, fans are hoping that this new firefighter and paramedic will stick around for good.</p><p>Chicago Fire airs on NBC on Wednesdays at 9 p.m. EST and streams on <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Peacock</a>.</p><p><b>For more on Chicago Fire, check out this gallery to see where the <a href=# rel=noopener>Chicago Fire alums are now</a>.</b></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmrKeRpcBwusSwqmhvYmp%2BeIGOp5ywZZaev6ayyKCfrZ2iYrCptcKanqhllp6%2Fpns%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fnew-firefighter-chicago-fire.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fnew-firefighter-chicago-fire.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fnew-firefighter-chicago-fire.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fnew-firefighter-chicago-fire.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fnew-firefighter-chicago-fire.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fnew-firefighter-chicago-fire.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./ben-and-jerrys-announces-plans-to-release-cbd-infused-ice-cream.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./ben-and-jerrys-announces-plans-to-release-cbd-infused-ice-cream.html>Ben and Jerry's Announces Plans to Release CBD-Infused Ice Cream</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./what-happened-to-siobhan-mcsweeney-teeth-and-leg-were-they-broken-in-an-accident.html>What Happened To Siobhn McSweeney Teeth And Leg?

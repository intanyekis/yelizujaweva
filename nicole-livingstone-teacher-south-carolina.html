The video then clearly shows Livingston aggressively following and accosting Barnwell.&nbsp;</p><p>Reports indicate that she was ‘snatching at her, pushing her to the wall, and berating her’ for not standing for the Pledge of Allegiance.</p><p>Unfortunately, her disbelief soon turned to fear within seconds as she heard herself saying, ‘get your hands off me.’ It is clear from this encounter that no student should be subjected to such treatment in any school setting.</p><p>Marissa Barnwell’s parents are filing a lawsuit against the teacher, principal, and education departments for violating their daughter’s constitutional rights.&nbsp;</p><p>The federal complaint states that Barnwell was left feeling disrespected and unable to react from being approached so angrily, simply for not participating in the pledge of allegiance.</p><p>She adds that she has never seen this teacher before and had no warning of what would happen.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, the lawsuit serves to protect her rights as well as those of other students who chose to express themselves differently or opt out of certain activities at school.</p><p>Barnwell’s experience is heartbreaking and not unique. With no apology from her school district or the faculty member who pushed her, it appears that she will have to continue living with the unresolved pain of the incident.&nbsp;</p><p>She should never have been subjected to such violence in what is meant to be a safe learning environment, yet when she raised the issue with her principal, his response only compounded it.</p><p>Going through something so traumatic and then being met with this kind of dismissive attitude implies that many schools prioritize respect for authority figures over student safety – an unacceptable state of affairs.</p><p>Every day during school, the students of South Carolina recite the Pledge of Allegiance in accordance with a law enacted by the state legislature over 30 years ago.&nbsp;</p><p>However, this law is also responsible for granting students their right to remain silent and opt-out of reciting pledge. One student experienced this first-hand when an administrator harshly questioned her decision.&nbsp;</p><p>After the incident, the student emphasized that something like this should never happen again in South Carolina or any other state in America; no one should be punished for exercising their constitutional right under the First Amendment to protest and not say the pledge.</p><p>Last month, a lawsuit was filed against a school district over their policy on the Pledge of Allegiance. According to this policy, students are not required to stand when reciting the Pledge.</p><p>However, when Marissa Barnwell’s parents tried to raise the issue with the school’s principal and assistant principal, they were met with an insulting response.&nbsp;</p><p>The question that was posed asking if they had provoked Marissa in any way revealed an underlying prejudice and unfairness that forced the <a href=#>family</a> to take a stand.</p><p>After conversing ineffectually with school board members, the Barnwell family chose to make their case valid through legal means.&nbsp;</p><p>Fynale Barnwell, Marissa’s mother, spoke about her wish for equality for black children: <strong>“It’s 2023, and it’s time for change”.</strong> The Barnwell family has certainly made a brave move to register their complaint and demand justice in its purest form.</p><p>There is an undeniable injustice in this incident that demands serious consideration and reparation.&nbsp;</p><p>As the family’s attorney emphasized, students of all backgrounds should feel safe to freely express themselves without fear of consequence, and those rights to expression should be well-protected both in society and within academic institutions.</p><p>The lack of official communication from the school board suggests that this critical matter has been either overlooked or neglected, leaving open a concerning dialogue surrounding whose rights are acknowledged, respected, and assumably granted privilege by various governing bodies.&nbsp;</p><p>Suppose we are to call ourselves a nation of civil liberty, as is our long-standing tradition. In that case, we must ensure that each citizen enjoys the full benefit of their Constitutional rights.</p><p>Livingston was not arrested or charged with any offenses by the Town of Lexington Police Department, according to WLTX.&nbsp;</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunC6yJympZ1doba3tc2gqq2nnpp6tbHAnJ%2Beql2ovLbAx2aamqqfobavrY4%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fnicole-livingstone-teacher-south-carolina.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fnicole-livingstone-teacher-south-carolina.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fnicole-livingstone-teacher-south-carolina.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fnicole-livingstone-teacher-south-carolina.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fnicole-livingstone-teacher-south-carolina.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fnicole-livingstone-teacher-south-carolina.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./sophie-shalhoub.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./sophie-shalhoub.html>Sophie Shalhoub (Tony Shalhoub Daughter) Wikipedia, Bio, Age, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Net Wor</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./mina-tobias-age-madchen-amicks-daughter-wiki-boyfriend-instagram-domain-6.html>Mina Tobias Age: Madchen Amicks Daughter, Wiki, Boyfriend Instagram, twitter</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./mina-tobias-age-madchen-amicks-daughter-wiki-boyfriend-instagram-domain-6.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

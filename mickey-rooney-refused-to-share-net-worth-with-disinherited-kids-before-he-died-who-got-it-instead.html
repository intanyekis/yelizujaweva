In some cases, that has led to problems like <a href=#>Tori Spelling struggling financially</a> despite how much money her father left to others.</p><p>After decades of working in Hollywood, the legendary actor Mickey Rooney passed away in 2014. After Rooney took his final breath, it was revealed to the public that he left nothing to the many children he fathered during his 93 years of living.</p><h2 id=how-did-mickey-rooney-go-broke>How Did Mickey Rooney Go Broke?</h2><p>At the height of Mickey Rooney's career, he accomplished something that very few people have in the history of Hollywood. For three years straight in 1939, 1949, and 1941, Rooney was the biggest box office attraction in the movie industry.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/mickey-rooney-and-bonita-granville-s-publicity-photo.jpg><p>Back when Rooney was at the top of Hollywood, he reportedly was the highest-paid performer in the business. Even when his career started to go downhill, the actor continued to act throughout the rest of his life.</p><p>Looking back at Rooney's career, it certainly seems like he should have been rich throughout his life. On top of that, most people likely assume that Rooney left behind a massive fortune when he passed away.</p><p>In reality, however, Rooney lost almost all of his money in a truly tragic and shocking turn of events. Before getting to that, there is another thing that anyone wanting to understand Rooney's finances has to learn first.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Was Jill Duggar Cut Off From Her Family Long Before That Doomed Interview?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>These days, it is pretty common for the biggest movie stars to be paid $20 million or more for a single performance. In some cases, there have been some actors that have been paid tens of millions more than that for a single project if they have the clout to demand a share of the profits.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/mickey-rooney-refused-to-share-the-remainder-of-his-once-colossal-net-worth-with-his-disinherited-kids-before-he-died-here-s-who-got-it-instead.jpg><p>Back when Rooney was the biggest movie star in the world, figures like that were completely unfathomable. According to Celebrity Net Worth, when Rooney was the highest-paid actor in the world, he <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">was only being paid $25,000 per movie</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, since a lot has changed since the '30s and '40s, that figure has to be adjusted for inflation. Celebrity Net Worth reports that Rooney would have been paid roughly $275,000 per movie in today's dollars. Since Rooney worked a lot those days, they also report that he made roughly $2.5 million in today's dollars annually when he was at the height of his career.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/jan-chamberlin-and-mickey-rooney-s-star-on-the-hollywood-walk-of-fame.jpg><p>All things considered, even though Rooney is a legend with many stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, he was never even close to as rich as today's biggest stars. That said, he still should have been able to live comfortably until the day he died.</p><p>Tragically for Rooney, it appears that someone he should have been able to trust was most responsible for his financial losses. After Rooney got a court-appointed conservator named Michael R. Augustine, they sued the actor's stepson Christopher Aber.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Similar to other stars like <a href=#>Kate Gosselin who've become estranged from their children</a>, Rooney didn't have a relationship with his biological children. As a result, when Rooney got older and needed assistance in his day-to-day life, he began leaning on his stepson Christopher Aber.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Philip Seymour Hoffman Refused To Give His Children Any of His Humongous Estate After His Death, Here's Who Got It Instead</a></span></p><p>According to the lawsuit that was filed on Rooney's behalf, Christopher Aber and his wife Christina Aber "financially and verbally abused" the famous actor. Further, the lawsuit alleged that the Abers went to great lengths to have near-complete control over Rooney for a decade.</p><p>In the legal filing that was presented on Rooney's behalf, they alleged that the Abers went through the following process, so they could take advantage of the actor.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The first step of that process was that Christopher Aber had himself named an account owner who had control over Rooney's banking. Secondly, the Abers set up a P.O. Box and had all of Rooney's mail sent there.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/mickey-rooney-and-christopher-aber-before-the-lawsuit.jpg><p>The lawsuit alleges that once the Abers had control over Rooney's accounts and the information going to him, they took control over his life. In some cases, that allegedly meant withholding food and medication which would leave Rooney feeling depressed.</p><p>More notably for this article, the Abers allegedly used the money in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rooney's account to pay their personal expenses</a>. If that wasn't bad enough, the Abers also simply transferred money to their account according to the lawsuit.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ultimately, the Abers settled the lawsuit that was filed on Rooney's behalf and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">agreed to pay back $2.8 million</a> as well as undisclosed punitive damages. Of course, many lawsuits end and the people involved don't pay what they agreed to. Sadly, the Abers don't seem to have paid up since Rooney's estate upon his passing was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reportedly worth just $18,000</a>.</p><h2 id=who-inherited-mickey-rooney-39-s-estate>Who Inherited Mickey Rooney's Estate?</h2><p>After Mickey Rooney passed away, The Hollywood Reporter published an article about the actor's "disturbing final years". In that piece, Gary Baum and Scott Feinberg <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote about Rooney's relationship with his biological children</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Anna Nicole Smith Battled The Son Of Her Dead Billionaire Husband For Most Of His Estate, Here's How Much She Won</a></span></p><p>"Left in the wake of this were 10 children with whom Rooney elected to have little contact; indeed, in his 1991 autobiography, he devoted more words to his pets than his kids."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Because Rooney was estranged from his biological children to the point that they weren't part of his life, it isn't surprising they weren't left anything. It could also be argued that Rooney leaving nothing to his widow is understandable since they were separated before he passed even though they never divorced.</p><p>What is bound to get some people questioning things, however, is what happened to Rooney's estate. According to reports, Rooney altered his will three weeks before his passing to leave everything to his stepson, Mark Aber.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/mickey-rooney-before-his-passing.jpg><p>For anyone who recognizes that name, Aber, that is because Christopher able got sued by Rooney, and he isn't the one who got his estate. No, it was his brother, Mark Aber.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After getting the estate, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark Aber was accused of holding Rooney hostage in his final days</a> and neglecting him which allegedly led to the actor's passing. In a surprising twist, it was Christopher Aber who accused Mark Aber of mistreating Rooney even though he was sued for the same thing.</p><p>After Rooney passed away, there was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a fight over his remains</a> and the legendary actor's estate. Ultimately, those fights were dropped and Mark Aber walked away with the estate.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGikopubmsZuvs6opZ6xXaeyp8HSnptmrJ9iwKmt0Z5kp52kYsSwvtOhZLChpJ16pbXSoqWhnaKewaawjKSgnatdl7Knu9GeZKGdXZm2prCMsJ%2BoZZekwW6102agp6ukmq6lew%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmickey-rooney-refused-to-share-net-worth-with-disinherited-kids-before-he-died-who-got-it-instead.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmickey-rooney-refused-to-share-net-worth-with-disinherited-kids-before-he-died-who-got-it-instead.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmickey-rooney-refused-to-share-net-worth-with-disinherited-kids-before-he-died-who-got-it-instead.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmickey-rooney-refused-to-share-net-worth-with-disinherited-kids-before-he-died-who-got-it-instead.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmickey-rooney-refused-to-share-net-worth-with-disinherited-kids-before-he-died-who-got-it-instead.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmickey-rooney-refused-to-share-net-worth-with-disinherited-kids-before-he-died-who-got-it-instead.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./nelly-and-ashanti-go-instagram-official-with-sweet-birthday-tribute.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./nelly-and-ashanti-go-instagram-official-with-sweet-birthday-tribute.html>Nelly and Ashanti Go Instagram Official With Sweet Birthday Tribute</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./lupita-nyongo-elated-brother-ditches-bachelorhood.html>Lupita Nyong'o Elated As Kid Brother Ditches Bachelorhood [Photos]</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./lupita-nyongo-elated-brother-ditches-bachelorhood.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

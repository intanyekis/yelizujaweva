We're not entirely sure what it could've done for her personal career, however, we know for sure it could've made her a lot richer. We'll delve into the details and why she ultimately decided to pass.</p><h2 id=prime-fame-on-39-buffy-the-vampire-slayer-39>Prime Fame On 'Buffy The Vampire Slayer'</h2><p>What were you doing at the age of 4? Well, Sarah Michelle Gellar had already started her acting career, after she was spotted by an agent in New York at a restaurant. Soon enough, she was already auditioning for a part on a TV film.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the age of 20, her career breakthrough would already take place when she was cast as 'Buffy The Vampire Slayer'.</p><p>The show was a huge success and it changed her career, lasting seven seasons and 144 episodes.</p><p>What the actress is most proud of, is how the show touched on some major issues, according to the star of the show, <a href=#>it was very much ahead of its time</a> in terms of the problems it addressed.</p><p>“I have always believed that what was so unique about the show was the use of horrors of those formative years,” says Gellar. “With high school and college as a backdrop, we were able to address racism, identity, bullying, guilt, death, first love, and heartbreak using the demons as metaphors for the demons we all experience."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Everything Sarah Michelle Gellar Has Been In Since 'Buffy The Vampire Slayer'</a></span></p><p>She was on top of her game at that point and soon enough, she would receive a huge offer, to pose for a certain magaine.</p><h2 id=turning-down-playboy>Turning Down Playboy</h2><p>We have seen so many stars pose for 'Playboy' in the past. Not only does it create huge exposure for the star, especially in the '90s, but it can also be very profitable. However, not everyone is comfortable with the idea of posing for the magazine, and that includes Buffy herself. According to Baklol, she was offered $2 million to pose.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Here's Why Katie Holmes Turned Down The Role Of 'Buffy The Vampire Slayer'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The offer came during her prime run on Buffy. Ultimately, she said no, and given his personal views away from the camera, it makes complete sense that she turned down the offer, despite the huge sum of money that was thrown her way.</p><h2 id=advocate-for-female-empowerment>Advocate For Female Empowerment</h2><p>Even back in the day when women empowerment movements weren't as prevalent, <a href=#>Gellar was still taking a stance</a>, as a strong independent woman.</p><p>"I don't call myself a feminist because feminism has a negative connotation. It makes you think of women who don't shave their legs. But feminism is not just about not being weak. It's about being able to take care of yourself. Just because you might care about what you look like or what the opposite sex thinks of you, it doesn't make you not a feminist, although it's a word I hate. Do I consider myself a strong female individual? Uh-huh. Can I take care of myself? Yes."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Gellar admits, the system was flawed her during her prime run on the show, "I think that at the time I assumed all roles were going to be like that because, why shouldn’t women be the leads and why shouldn’t women kick butt?”</p><p>To her credit, she never shies away from her true feelings. It is believed that creator Joss Whedon created a tough work environment during the show's run. Despite all her success on the show, she issued a statement via IG, claiming <a href=#>she wants no attachment to the creator </a>of the popular series.</p><p>"While I am proud to have my name associated with Buffy Summers, I don't want to be forever associated with the name Joss Whedon," she wrote. "I am more focused on raising my family and surviving a pandemic currently, so I will not be making any further statements at this time. But I stand with all survivors of abuse and am proud of them for speaking out."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She certainly keeps her standards high and isn't afraid to take on stance on what is right. This might also reflect on her decision to skip out on Playboy, despite all her fame at the time and money thrown her way.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT - <a href=#>The Cast Of 'Buffy The Vampire Slayer': Who Is The Richest Today?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dosKktIympqedqWKxqrCMrJirmZhiuqqvx56jpZ1dnLKtuMCrZK2toqN6pbvWp2Sfqp%2BierG4wLKZqLFf</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhow-much-money-did-sarah-michelle-gellar-turn-down-from-playboy.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fhow-much-money-did-sarah-michelle-gellar-turn-down-from-playboy.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fhow-much-money-did-sarah-michelle-gellar-turn-down-from-playboy.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fhow-much-money-did-sarah-michelle-gellar-turn-down-from-playboy.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhow-much-money-did-sarah-michelle-gellar-turn-down-from-playboy.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhow-much-money-did-sarah-michelle-gellar-turn-down-from-playboy.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./ivana-rojas-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-142298-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./ivana-rojas-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-142298-html.html>Ivana Rojas Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./david-katzman-net-worth.html>David Katzman Net Worth | TheRichest</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./david-katzman-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

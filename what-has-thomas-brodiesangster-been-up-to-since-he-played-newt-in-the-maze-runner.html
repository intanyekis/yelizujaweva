The <a href=#>31-year-old actor</a> landed his first on-screen role aged 11 in the TV film Station Jim, alongside renowned British actors David Bradley and Celia Imrie. He continued to act regularly, landing eight more on-screen roles before he stole hearts as the lovable (and love-sick) 13-year-old Sam in 2003's <a href=#>cult classic Christmas rom-com Love, Actually</a>. It's this role, his first released cinematically, that Brodie-Sangster credits with kickstarting his two-decade-long career on screen.

Brodie-Sangster starred in the young adult dystopic thrillers alongside heartthrobs Dylan O'Brien and Kaya Scodelario. And while those two went on to have illustrious careers starring in Teen Wolf and Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean series, what happened to Brodie-Sangster? The actor has stayed booked and busy in the years since, even managing to nab a nomination at the 2021 Emmy Awards.</p><h2 id=he-finished-up-a-two-year-run-on-39-game-of-thrones-39><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>He Finished Up A Two-Year Run On 'Game Of Thrones'</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>2014 was a busy year for the London-born actor, seeing the release of the first Maze Runner movie, a starring role in Phantom Halo alongside X-Men's Rebecca Romijn, and a "comical" death in Game of Thrones. Brodie-Sangster joined the best of British talent for a two-season spell on HBO's long-running fantasy show. First appearing in season three, Brodie-Sangster's portrayal of Jojen Reed lasted ten episodes before his character met his demise.

"5 years of joy and hard work conclude on Jan 25th when Maze Runner The Death Cure releases!" the actor wrote in a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">rare appearance on Twitter</a>. "It would mean a lot to everyone involved in all 3 movies if you went and saw our film. We all put so much in to this one & to have people go & watch our work would be the cherry on a BIG cake."

Eagle-eyed fans noticed the lifelong Star Wars fan as Petty Officer Thanisson, the First Order officer who tries to prevent Poe and Finn from escaping via TIE fighter.

They family performed together for around seven years, playing the jazz clubs of South London. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">He also plays music with his co-star Dylan O'Brien</a>, with the actor explaining, "as a bass player you really need a drummer to jam." <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The two formed a band</a> called The Apologies while on set filming in South Africa. “We found this great little jam spot," he said. "We would go every weekend and we’d get other people from the crew; anyone that played guitar, anyone that played the tambourine, anyone that played anything. We ended up having the wrap party there.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-39-travelled-39-back-in-time><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>He 'Travelled' Back In Time</span></h2><p>The actor donned a cape and rode a horse in 1520's England playing Rafe Sadler in the Golden Globe-winning miniseries Wolf Hall alongside fellow Brit <strong>Tom Holland</strong>. The six-part series was based on Hilary Mantel's Man Booker Prize-winning novel which told the story of the court of King Henry VIII. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The actor's youthful appearance</a> allowed him to play the 15-year-old character despite being 25 at the time.</p><h2 id=he-finally-got-the-girl><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>He Finally Got The Girl</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2017 the actor reunited with his Love, Actually costars, thirteen years after the film's release to record a television short film sequel.

I did wonder, ‘how important is it to me?’ But I missed it,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he told NME</a>. “I missed the wonderful freedom of being able to explore all of those kinds of questions but doing it through a character. I think that’s the most interesting thing about acting." Brodie-Sangster returned to work to film 2020's The Queen's Gambit and was excited to immediately jump into his next project after filming wrapped on the Netflix show, but the world had other plans. "I left [The Queen's Gambit] feeling like ‘I can’t wait for the next job!’ And then this all happened…" he said, referring to the 2020 coronavirus-induced lockdown. "Kind of annoying! I can't wait for the next job.

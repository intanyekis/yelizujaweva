Her love for music started at a very young age, and by the time she was 17, she was ready to go on tour.</p><p>Of course, it's not that simple to plan a tour when the singer is underage. <strong>In 2007, she was supposed to join Kenny Chesney on his Flip-Flop Summer Tour as an opening act. However, when a beer company became the sponsor of the tour, she was no longer able to participate due to being underage</strong>.</p><p>It was not her fault or Kenny Chesney's, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">but she was heartbroken nonetheless</a>. "I was devastated," the pop star said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Luckily, not all was lost. When the country star found out that Taylor had been removed from the tour, he wanted to make her feel better, and he sent her a note saying "I'm sorry that you couldn’t come on the tour, so I wanted to make it up to you," Taylor Swift shared. <strong>Alongside the note, Kenny had sent a check "for more money than I'd ever seen in my life. I was able to pay my band bonuses. I was able to pay for my tour buses. I was able to fuel my dreams.</strong>"</p><h2 id=kenny-chesney-always-knew-taylor-swift-would-make-it-but-he-didn-39-t-know-how-big-she-39-d-get>Kenny Chesney Always Knew Taylor Swift Would Make It, But He Didn't Know How Big She'd Get</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/kenny-chesney-2023-cma-awards.jpg><p>Kenny Chesney was moved when he read how much his sweet gesture meant to her. <strong>"I was stunned she remembered it," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he admitted</a>.

When she couldn’t do our tour and then she surprised me at a couple of shows and came onstage to sing with me, I saw that look in her eyes that you can’t teach. <strong>I told my promoter, 'This child is going to be something one day.'

His mother, Anne, is a top-rated actress in Hollywood, having worked in movies like Interstellar, The Dark Knight Rises, Les Misrables, and much more.</h2></div><div class=content><div class=post-meta><div><i class="fa fa-calendar fa-fw"></i>
<time>08 Jun 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><strong>Jack Shulman</strong> is now recognized as a celebrity kid, and this credit goes to his parents. He is the son of <strong>Anne Hathaway</strong> and <strong>Adam Shulman</strong>. His mother, Anne, is a top-rated actress in Hollywood, having worked in movies like <i>Interstellar, The Dark Knight Rises, Les Misérables,</i> and much more.</p><p>Shulman's father, Adam, is a jewelry designer with some movie experience. He has produced <i>Song One, Seesaw Monster, </i>and <i>The Shower</i>. Likewise, Adam has acted in<i> American Dreams, The West Wing, </i>and <i>Song One. &nbsp;</i></p><h2>How Did Jack Shulman's Parents Meet?&nbsp;</h2><p>Jack Shulman's parents, Anne Hathaway and Adam Shulman met because of a common friend. The two tied the knot on <strong>September 29, 2012</strong>. This came after an engagement around a year ago, on November 28, 2011. They dated each other for four years before taking their relationship to the next level.&nbsp;</p><p>The engagement between Anne and Adam was special. It was made memorable by the engagement ring that Adam gave to Hathaway. Since Shulman's father is a jewelry designer, he made a custom ring to propose to Hathaway. And now they are a happily married couple.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/1/14/ezgif.com-gif-maker%20(1)-1673675648108.jpg><p>Anne wasn't in the best state when she first met Adam, as she still hadn't fully gotten over her previous relationship with Raffaello Follieri. But, for Jack's mother, it was love at first sight.&nbsp;</p><p>Anne was so confident about it that she was certain Adam would be her husband in the future. And she was right, as the two are living an amazing life together as husband and wife.</p><h2>About Jack's Parent's Net Worth</h2><p>Jack Shulman is fortunate to have been born into a family that can afford all of his wishes. &nbsp;His mother, Anne Hathaway, has an estimated net worth of <strong>$80 Million</strong>, and his father, Adam Shulman, has a net worth of<strong> $1 Million</strong>.</p><p>Hathaway's incredible acting has not only brought her a lot of praise but also a lot of money as well. She reportedly earns an average of $5 Million to $10 Million<strong> </strong>per movie. Per reports published in <a href=# rel=nofollow><i>Cosmopolitan</i></a>, the highest she has been paid for one movie is $10 Million from<i> Les Misérables.</i> Even for her TV Show, <i>Wecrashed</i>, she reportedly made<strong> $750,000 </strong>per episode.</p><p>On the other hand, Jack's father, Adam's income, comes from his jewelry design works. He co-owns a business called James Banks Design, a pretty successful company. His other income sources (if any) remain to be discovered. &nbsp;</p><h2>Has A Sibling</h2><p>Shulman isn't the only son <i>The Hustle</i> actress Hathaway shares with Adam. He has an older sibling named <a href=# rel=nofollow>Jonathan Rosebanks Shulman</a>. The firstborn son of Hathaway was born three years before Shulman on<strong> March 24, 2016</strong>. The two sons are known as celebrity kids like <a href=#><strong>Molly June Benio.</strong></a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/1/14/94ba0851db09954569567b7ba8217782%20(1)-1673675875698.jpg><p>Both of Shulman parents are busy people. So, having a sibling can help as siblings get along in a manner parents can't deal with their kids. Also, there isn't much age difference, which helps them develop an amazing brother relationship.</p><h2>Shulman's Mother Hathaway Suffered From Fertility Issues</h2><p>Shulman's mother, Hathaway, had fertility issues in the past. <i>The Brokeback Mountain</i> actress had to struggle a lot dealing with pregnancies. Hence, her son, Jonathan and Jack are even more special to her.</p><p>Having experienced fertility issues, Hathaway now uses her voice to raise awareness. She realized the need to bring it up as she experienced how hard it was that there was no one to talk to about it. She wants to ensure an environment where women struggling to conceive can openly discuss it without discomfort.</p><h2>Jack Shulman's Uncle's Sexual Orientation Impacted His Mother's Life</h2><p>Jack's uncle <strong>Michael Hathaway's</strong> sexual orientation majorly impacted his mother, Anne Hathaway's life. Michael coming out as gay impacted her relationship with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/1/14/https___prod.static9.net.au___media_Network_The-Fix_Celebs_MARCH_MARCH-4_MARCH-5_anne%20(1)-1673676394761.jpg><p>The <i>Interstellar </i>actress Anne used to be a devout catholic. However, her brother being a homosexual was not accepted by the church. She had two choices: continue with the church or leave it for her brother. She went with the latter as she didn't want to be associated with an institution where her brother had no place.</p><h2>Who Is Jack's Grandparents?</h2><p><i>Anne Hathaway's son</i> Jack is the grandson of <strong>Gerald Hathaway </strong>and <strong>Kate McCauley Hathaway</strong>. His grandparents may be famous because of his mother, Anne, but that doesn't mean they were successful people themselves.</p><p>Jack's grandfather Gerald is a lawyer by profession. He serves as an advisory board member at the Centre for Labor and Employment Law at NYU School of Law. He is also on the board of visitors at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law.</p><p>Kate is a former actress who has worked in <i>The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement </i>and <i>South Pacific.</i> While filming <i>South Pacific,</i> Kate was pregnant with her first child. She is a woman of steel and a lot of guts as she performed cartwheels for the role while having the four-month-old baby in her womb.</p><h2>Anne Hathaway Was Pregnant With Jack Shulman While Shooting For The Witches</h2><p>Anne Hathaway was pregnant with Jack Shulman while shooting for <i>The Witches</i>. <i>The Dark Night Rises</i> actress Anne also said that it shows with her performance in the film that she is pregnant with a son had an impact on the role. Unfortunately, people didn't like the film, and it became one of the most controversial things she had done.&nbsp;</p><figure class=media></figure><p><i>The Witcher </i>became controversial because of the character she portrayed and not because of her son. Her character of a witch had three limbs, and people took problems with that as they believed the movie was insensitive to disabled people. <a href=# rel=nofollow><i>Variety </i></a>has reported that she had to apologize for it formally. She particularly apologized to the children with limb differences, who she believed were most hurt.</p><p>This wasn't the first time Hathaway had done shooting while pregnant. She had done the same when Shulman's brother Jonathan was in her womb. She was five months pregnant with her older son when she finished the shooting of her film <i>Colossal</i>. She also started shooting for her film <i>Ocean's Eight</i> just seven months after giving birth to Jonathan.</p><h2>Hathaway Uses Santa To Discipline Shulman And His Brother</h2><p>Hathaway uses Santa Clause to discipline her two sons. Every time her elder son tries to do something stupid, she brings up Santa, and he immediately starts to behave well. Both <a href=# rel=nofollow>Adam Shulman's </a>sons are still young, so disciplining them is necessary, but it's far from easy.</p><p>Hathaway brought it up on<i> The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon</i>, where she shared a tiny little story. The story happened in their car when Sulman sat in the back seat with his brother. He started crying for the crackers which his older brother had, but he refused to give them. Then, Hathaway brought up Santa, and Jonathan acted like a good boy.</p><p><i>Like reading Anne Hathaway's son Jack Shulman's bio?

He was born in the second-largest city in Sierra Leone, Kenema.&nbsp;</p><p>Like an action movie, Kamara has his early childhood narration. During his childhood, his mother won a 1990 immigration lottery and left for Los Angeles to help support the family.&nbsp;</p><p>She sent him to live with his aunt and cousins in Sierra Leone, where the civil war between its army and anti-government rebels commenced.</p><p>He lived in a large family where his elder brothers kept him safe when rebels and government soldiers alternately lived with them for weeks.</p><p>Kamara saw everything as a child that shouldn’t be known or seen. Additionally, he knew terrors, fears, and death all too well for a kid.</p><p>He witnessed the forced recruiting of children into the war and the death that followed those who refused.&nbsp;</p><p>“I lived through it my whole childhood. It was very, very scary. I tried to understand these things I heard about the Taliban and Al-Qaeda, and I’m like, ‘That’s not what I was taught as a Muslim.”<br>-Kei Kamara</p><h3>Reunion With Mother & Life Onward</h3><p>Kamara fled Sierra Leone with his family and moved to the Gambia when he was 14, and he waited two years before finally reuniting with his mother.</p><p>However, he first moved to Baltimore, where his uncle resided, and by age 16, he moved to Los Angeles as part of a refugee program.</p><p>Nearly a decade later, Kamara united with his mother and, thus, started attending California State University, Dominguez Hills as an American citizen.&nbsp;</p><p>As disclosed by Kamara, the children there mocked him due to his stuttering voice and accent.

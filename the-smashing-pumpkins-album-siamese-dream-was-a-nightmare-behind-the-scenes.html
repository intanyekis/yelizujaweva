During the recording of the seminal album, the band was dealing with chaos, but they ultimately pulled it off, and launched themselves into the stratosphere.</p><p>Let's take a look at the band, the making of the album, and how they overcame their demons to create a classic record.</p><h2 id=the-smashing-pumpkins-are-a-legacy-band-with-incredible-records>The Smashing Pumpkins Are A Legacy Band With Incredible Records</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/instar52052283.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Smashing Pumpkins, an iconic rock band that emerged from the alternative rock scene of the 1990s, have left an indelible mark on the music industry. With their unique sound, powerful lyrics, and a career spanning several decades, the band's legacy is one that continues to resonate with music lovers of all ages.</p><p>The band's breakthrough came with their second album, Siamese Dream, released in 1993. Produced by Butch Vig, this album catapulted them to fame and critical acclaim. Tracks like "Today," "Disarm," and "Cherub Rock" became instant classics and showcased Corgan's songwriting prowess. Siamese Dream remains one of the most celebrated albums in alternative rock history.</p><p>The late '90s brought challenges to the band, including lineup changes and personal struggles. D'arcy Wretzky departed, and Melissa Auf der Maur briefly filled the bassist role. Despite the difficulties, The Smashing Pumpkins continued to produce noteworthy albums like Adore and MACHINA/The Machines of God.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Time has been kind to the band, as they are largely regarded as legends.</p><p>Circling back to Siamese Dream, the album was a monster hit, but the process of making the record proved to be a chaotic time for the band,</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/kanye-west-is-preparing-to-release-another-album-as-bianca-censori-leads-his-music-and-fashion-comeback.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Kanye West Is Preparing To Release Another Album As Bianca Censori Leads His Music And Fashion Comeback">Kanye West Is Preparing To Release Another Album As Bianca Censori Leads His Music And Fashion Comeback</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>The only problem is it may only be exclusively available on the Stem player.</p><h2 id=the-band-had-numerous-issues-while-recording-siamese-dream>The Band Had Numerous Issues While Recording Siamese Dream</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/instar42185976.jpg><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ultimate Classic Rock</a>, the band's members were going through it while making the record.</p><p>"What affected [Siamese Dream] was [the feeling that] you’d better sell a lot of records. Because you were facing a world with ‘indie’ bands selling 10 million copies. If you didn’t approximate those numbers, you were facing oblivion. I’ve never felt pressure like that in my life," Billy Corgan said about the pressures of making the album a hit.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Because of the pressures that he was facing, Corgan's mental health plummeted.</p><p>"I lost the ability to function. I didn’t want to go outside. I was eating like a pig and gaining weight. I couldn’t write songs," he once said.</p><p>Elsewhere in the band, guitarist, James Iha, and bassist, D'arcy Wretzky ended their romance. This undoubtedly made things tough on them, as well as the rest of the members of the band.</p><p>Drummer, Jimmy Chamberlain, was dealing with his addictions during this time, adding another layer of complexity to the recording process.</p><p>"Before and during the recording of Siamese Dream, and during the writing process, things were kind of f***** up. I think we weren’t mature enough not to take it out on each other," Wretzky said.</p><p>Incredibly, the band overcame these struggles, unleashing a classic record.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/olivia-rodrigo-has-embarrassing-malfunction-at-vmas-after-her-second-album-debuts-to-controversy.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Olivia Rodrigo Has Embarrassing Malfunction at VMAs After Her Second Album Debuts To Controversy">Olivia Rodrigo Has Embarrassing Malfunction at VMAs After Her Second Album Debuts To Controversy</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Olivia's performance didn't go as planned amid speculation over who her album is really about.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-album-was-a-success-and-is-a-39-90s-classic>The Album Was A Success, And Is A '90s Classic</h2><p>Upon its release, Siamese Dream was met with an overwhelmingly positive critical response. Music critics praised its sonic experimentation, Corgan's emotive songwriting, and the band's ability to seamlessly blend elements of alternative, shoegaze, and hard rock.</p><p>Commercially, the album soared. It debuted on the Billboard 200 chart and quickly went platinum. Hit singles like "Today" and "Disarm" received heavy airplay on MTV, introducing The Smashing Pumpkins to a global audience.

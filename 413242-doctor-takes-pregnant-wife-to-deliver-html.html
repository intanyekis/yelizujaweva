However, Caitlyn experienced a few complications at birth, and her husband only went home without one family member.</p><p class=Fg>Jared Wilson and his wife Caitlyn were on their way to welcome their second child together, but what was meant to be a glorious time for the couple ended up as a bittersweet moment.</p><p class=Fg>On December 12, 2022, Caitlyn was scheduled for an induction, so Wilson dropped her off at a hospital in New York where he was also an anesthesiologist resident. He left his wife at the facility and returned home to care for their one-year-old son, Lincoln.</p><p class=Fg>When Wilson left, everything was still fine and going according to plan. Caitlyn was given an epidural at around 01:00 a.m., and the doctor was meant to come in the morning to break her water and <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/doctors-wife-dies-days-after-giving-birth-to-their-baby-exclusive-7963753>induce labor</a>.</p><p class=Fg>The baby was still in a suitable position to make the birth easy, but after the doctor broke Caitlyn's water, the baby had his hand somewhat above his face, which shifted him directly behind the umbilical cord.</p><p class=Fg>Things started to look dangerous for the baby's health because his hand went out of the birth canal, and the neck pinched the umbilical cord. This resulted in what Wilson referred to as uterine cord prolapse, which would have put the baby's life at high risk.</p><p class=Fg>Caitlyn was then rushed into an emergency C-section, and her husband informed their parents and asked them to keep his wife in their prayers. She <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/doctors-wife-dies-days-after-giving-birth-to-their-baby-exclusive-7963753>underwent surgery</a> around 02:00 a.m. and was out in 10 minutes. The couple had welcomed their healthy baby boy, Gabriel, but now, the attention was back on Caitlyn, 27, to recover from the traumatic birth.</p><p><h2 class=Jg><strong class=Dg>What Happened to Caitlyn after Giving Birth?</strong></h2></p><p class=Fg>Wilson explained that general anesthesia bears the risk of small amounts of fluids flowing into the lungs. Things for Caitlyn started to get complicated when the doctor had to transition her from the anesthesia to an intubation.</p><p class=Fg>The epidural was starting to wear off, so the feeling in her stomach was starting to come back. However, things looked fine once she was put on an intubate and moved from into her room.</p><p class=Fg>Caitlyn was also <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/doctors-wife-dies-days-after-giving-birth-to-their-baby-exclusive-7963753>put on oxygen</a>, but the surgery was done pretty quickly, so the recovery time was bound to take long. Nonetheless, the doctors were optimistic because, from the look of things, the surgery had gone well, and the baby was thriving.</p><p class=Fg>The oxygen was there to help her breathe because she was inflamed from the intubation transition. Wilson also mentioned that his wife had gone into labor with a minor case of bronchitis. So, every time Caitlyn coughed, it felt like her stomach was about to rip open.</p><p class=Fg>Things started to go wrong ten days after she gave birth. There was she was dealing with, between recovering from her C-section, the stress of not being able to bond with her child, low milk production, and the need for oxygen when all she wanted to be home with her <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/doctors-wife-dies-days-after-giving-birth-to-their-baby-exclusive-7963753>newborn baby</a>.</p><p class=Fg>Caitlyn's lungs and breathing problems did not get better. The mother of two needed more oxygen and was quickly transferred to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Her husband said breathing was now exhausting, and she wanted to be moved to a machine that would help her.</p><p class=Fg>But she did not respond to the machine. Wilson said they tried to connect Caitlyn to it, and in normal cases, it automatically connects to the human's respiratory system, but that did not happen with Caitlyn.</p><p class=Fg>From there, doctors could not keep Caitlyn awake anymore. Doctors reportedly discovered blood clots with one suspected to have gone to her heart. Her lungs also started filling up with liquid, and the mother was on the verge of organ failure.</p><p class=Fg>The next step was to put her through dialysis to get the acid out of her blood, but Caitlyn was not coping. Wilson was allowed into the room because of his profession. He tried to help with the compression, but nothing helped. His wife died in his arms and his only option was to switch off the machines.</p><p class=Fg>He shared a sweet message for his late wife on Facebook, revealing that he found hidden love notes on his phone that she had written for him. 'I'm blessed to have a wife who, even in her passing, has left words of comfort for me, dated years ago, to tell me how much she loved her place as a wife and mother," <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/doctors-wife-dies-days-after-giving-birth-to-their-baby-exclusive-7963753>said</a> Wilson.</p><p class=Fg>As Wilson deals with the loss of his wife and the mother of his children, he has set up a <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.gofundme.com/f/jared-and-caitlyn?fbclid=IwAR3G6KsMFUsrcDV89T5ziSU2-N2Gnp9oT2SYv4LaEJbKxeP2i4w-I1jmrEQ">GoFundMe</a> page to help him transition into this new and difficult normal with his family.</p><p class=Fg>Here is a <a class="Xd a" href=#>story</a> about a man who lost his wife and unborn child and cried when he read a note she wrote before her death.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jm1obGpkZ3qlu8KtpqtlpJa4pr%2BMqamen56Wu7V51qKdnmWkpHqlscuirZ6qXp3Brrg%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f413242-doctor-takes-pregnant-wife-to-deliver-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f413242-doctor-takes-pregnant-wife-to-deliver-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f413242-doctor-takes-pregnant-wife-to-deliver-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f413242-doctor-takes-pregnant-wife-to-deliver-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f413242-doctor-takes-pregnant-wife-to-deliver-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f413242-doctor-takes-pregnant-wife-to-deliver-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./heres-why-ciara-no-longer-talks-to-her-babys-father-future.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./heres-why-ciara-no-longer-talks-to-her-babys-father-future.html>Heres Why Ciara No Longer Talks To Her Babys Father, Future</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./did-r-kelly-get-special-treatment-in-jail.html>Did R.

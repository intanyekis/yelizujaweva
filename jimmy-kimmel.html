There are kids in high school, and this guy’s a baseball player, this guy’s on the wrestling team, this guy is really smart.”&nbsp;<strong>– JimmyKimmel&nbsp;</strong></p><p>“It’s funny how all of this has worked out – I wasn’t popular in high school, but now every drunken guy in the United States wants to be my pal. They all want to buy me a shot, and pretty soon I’m throwing up.”&nbsp;<strong>– JimmyKimmel&nbsp;</strong></p><p>“Here’s what I don’t understand about rioting. If you’re going to destroy a city for no reason, why destroy your own city? Move one city over.”&nbsp;<strong>– JimmyKimmel&nbsp;</strong></p><p>“The number of households that own a television set is down for the first time since they started the survey. This is America!

I had to throw away all my make-up. They said it’s because of this terrorist plot they foiled over in England. I believe it’s an elaborate ruse perpetrated by the big cosmetics industry.

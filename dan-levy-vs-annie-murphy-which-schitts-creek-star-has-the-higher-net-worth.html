After all, Catherine O'Hara and Eugene Levy have both been a big deal in the entertainment business for years which it isn’t shocking to see them <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">rubbing elbows with stars like Elton John</a>. On top of those two, Schitt’s Creek also starred Chris Elliott and he’d already appeared in several beloved movies and shows before he was cast as Roland Schitt.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After being on the air for a few years, Schitt’s Creek seemed to suddenly become a massive hit overnight partially because people were excited to see Eugen Levy and Catherine O'Hara again. Additionally, millions of comedy fans were excited to be introduced to Schitt’s Creek younger stars including Dan Levy and Annie Murphy.</p><p>Since Annie Murphy and Dan Levy first rose to fame, they have become two of the most talked-about young performers in the comedy world. As a result, it shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone that both of them have managed to cash in on their newfound success. However, that does beg an obvious question, who has a higher net worth, Dan Levy or Annie Murphy?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Truth About Tracy Chapman’s Impressive Net Worth</a></span></p><h2 id=murphy-s-millions>Murphy’s Millions</h2><p>Just when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Annie Murphy was going to quit acting</a>, she landed the role that would make her a star, Schitt’s Creek’s Alexis Rose. Over six seasons, Murphy portrayed Alexis in eighty episodes of the hit comedy and she did such a great job in the role that she won a Primetime Emmy. Since Schitt’s Creek became a massive success, it is safe to assume that Murphy was paid a pretty penny for her role in the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fortunately for everyone who loved Schitt’s Creek, most of the show’s stars have remained very busy since the series ended in 2020. For example, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Annie Murphy went on to star in Kevin Can F**k Himself</a>, a dark comedy that has been well received. Based in large part on the money she has made from her two hit series, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Annie Murphy has amassed $4 million</a> as of this writing according to celebritynetworth.com.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here’s How Poor Annie Murphy Was Before Getting Cast On 'Schitt’s Creek'</a></span></p><h2 id=dan-becomes-a-powerbroker>Dan Becomes A Powerbroker</h2><p>Most of the time when a show or movie becomes a big hit, people line up to try to take credit for its success. When it comes to Schitt’s Creek, there are a lot of people who played an important role in the show becoming a sensation. However, everyone involved seems to agree that one person deserves the lion’s share of the credit, Dan Levy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As the person who came up with Schitt’s Creek’s basic premise, the show was Dan Levy’s baby right from the start which is why he is credited as one of the series’ co-creators. Once Schitt’s Creek went into production, Dan starred in the show and took on just about every role behind the camera including directing, writing, and executive producing. Most importantly, Dan served as Schitt’s Creek’s showrunner which means he had more influence over the sitcom’s creative direction than anyone else.</p><p>Due to how incredibly important Dan Levy was to Schitt’s Creek’s success, it makes sense that he made a fortune once the show became a massive hit. On top of that, he has gone on to become a big enough star to land a role in a major movie like Happiest Season and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Levy was tapped to host Saturday Night Live</a>. Given all of that, it makes sense that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dan Levy is worth $14 million</a> according to ceebritynetworth.com.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How Close Are 'Schitt’s Creek’s' Eugene And Dan Levy?</a></span></p><h2 id=how-things-might-change>How Things Might Change</h2><p>As of this writing, Dan Levy is worth $10 million more than Annie Murphy according to celebritynetworth.com. Of course, it is no secret that the entertainment business can be incredibly fickle so Muprhy’s fortune could surpass Levy’s in the not too distant future. After all, Murphy's show Kevin Can F**k Himself seems like it could be poised for a second season return which would help her bank account grow in a big way. On top of that, anyone who has gone on YouTube in the last year likely will attest that Murphy has been hired to star in a slew of ads and if that trend continues, she could make millions.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though Annie Murphy’s career has loads of potential going forward, it still seems unlikely that she will become wealthier than Dan Levy in the immediate future. After all, Levy has become such a big deal that ABC signed him to a three-year overall deal after a massive bidding war. If any of the shows that Levy is poised to create for ABC become a hit, he could easily become rich beyond belief, let alone if he has several hit shows on the air. Considering how expertly Levy shepherded Schitt’s Creek through its six-season run, it seems likely that his new shows will go the distance too.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Who Was Dan Levy Before 'Schitt's Creek'?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibmqZdobK3xYyvqmaZnqO2pnnMrqmpoKlixKm1wqFkrJuYnsG1v4ycqZ6dm2LAta3RZp%2Baq12ptaZ5x6KeoZ2iYrumwIywpqusmGQ%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdan-levy-vs-annie-murphy-which-schitts-creek-star-has-the-higher-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdan-levy-vs-annie-murphy-which-schitts-creek-star-has-the-higher-net-worth.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdan-levy-vs-annie-murphy-which-schitts-creek-star-has-the-higher-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdan-levy-vs-annie-murphy-which-schitts-creek-star-has-the-higher-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdan-levy-vs-annie-murphy-which-schitts-creek-star-has-the-higher-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdan-levy-vs-annie-murphy-which-schitts-creek-star-has-the-higher-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./dwyane-wade-troll-terry-crews-gabrielle-union.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./dwyane-wade-troll-terry-crews-gabrielle-union.html>Dwyane Wade Trolls Terry Crews After He Tries Apologizing To Gabrielle Union</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./bachelor-in-paradise-carly-kirk-break-up-september-6-recap.html>Carly &amp;amp; Kirk Break Up, 12 Go Home September 6 Recap Hollywood Life</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./bachelor-in-paradise-carly-kirk-break-up-september-6-recap.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

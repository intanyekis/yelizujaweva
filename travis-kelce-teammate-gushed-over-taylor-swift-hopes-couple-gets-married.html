At the Super Bowl, their families even shared a suite. But it seems it's not only Travis' family that adore Taylor. His teammates are also very happy for them.</p><h2 id=travis-kelce-39-s-teammate-hopes-he-marries-taylor-swift>Travis Kelce's Teammate Hopes He Marries Taylor Swift</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/taylor-swift-watching-travis-kece.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Contrary to what some vicious haters want to convince everyone of, the Kansas City Chiefs couldn't be happier to have Taylor Swift around. Far from ruining the experience, she's opened the door for new fans to enjoy football, and anyone who loves the sport should be glad about it. Travis' teammates certainly are.</p><p><strong>Recently, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kansas City Chiefs kicker Harrison Butker spoke about the couple</a>, and surprised everyone saying "I hope they get married and start a family." He couldn't stop gushing about the pop star and how glad he is of her presence.</strong></p><p>"She thinks that's amazing that I can kick the ball so far through the uprights!" He gushed. <strong>"It was a great experience, and I can't say enough great things about her."</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>He also said that, while he's not exactly a swiftie, he was still apprehensive when he heard the singer would be coming to see them. "I was a little nervous to meet Taylor Swift. I mean, it's Taylor Swift. So maybe I am a Swiftie if I was nervous to meet her."</strong></p><p>He's probably talking about the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">secret meetings before Taylor and Travis' relationship became public</a>, when he took her to the stadium to meet his teammates before she actually showed up at a game. It's good that they did that, because that way the team got used to having a superstar there instead of looking up and finding her watching them. That would be nerve-wracking.</p><h2 id=travis-39-coaches-said-taylor-was-a-good-influence-on-the-team>Travis' Coaches Said Taylor Was A Good Influence On The Team</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/taylor-swift-and-travis-kelce-s-mom.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It seems in addition to bonding with Travis Kelce's parents, Taylor Swift has also been bonding with the team's crew. No one can deny that the Chiefs coaches' first priority is the team, so them saying she's good for the team means a lot.</p><p>Coach Andy Reid strongly denied that Taylor's presence in the stadium causes any form of distraction or disadvantage. <strong>On the contrary, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he praised the way she and Travis conduct themselves</a>. "It's a tribute to how she’s handled it, how Kelce has handled it," he stated. "It hasn't been a distraction, so there haven’t been any problems with it."</strong></p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ttweb_how-travis-kelce-handles-the-pressures-that-comes-with-dating-taylor-swift_bk_a1_v2.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="How Travis Kelce Handles The Pressures That Come With Dating Taylor Swift">How Travis Kelce Handles The Pressures That Come With Dating Taylor Swift</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Travis Kelce appears to be well-prepared to handle the pressures that come with dating a superstar like Taylor Swift.</p><p><strong>"She’s a good girl," the coach added. "She loves the game, and obviously loves Kelce. So I'm happy for both of them."</strong></p><p>For his part, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chiefs defensive coach, Dave Merritt, went a step further</a>, saying that Taylor's presence improves the team. <strong>"[Taylor Swift] actually affected the team in a positive way," he said, "Everybody was excited and Travis was happy</strong>. So when my player, a brother, is happy beside me, that helps me and encourages me, and so Travis came in there a different man. So, she helped us."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirq5mmnsBut8Slmp5lpJqurrnArZxmn6WotaawjKitnqpdqa66uM6rZKyvmZvBbrTOqZysZZOkwrG4xGaenqyjYrqivtGinJ1n</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftravis-kelce-teammate-gushed-over-taylor-swift-hopes-couple-gets-married.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ftravis-kelce-teammate-gushed-over-taylor-swift-hopes-couple-gets-married.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ftravis-kelce-teammate-gushed-over-taylor-swift-hopes-couple-gets-married.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ftravis-kelce-teammate-gushed-over-taylor-swift-hopes-couple-gets-married.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftravis-kelce-teammate-gushed-over-taylor-swift-hopes-couple-gets-married.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftravis-kelce-teammate-gushed-over-taylor-swift-hopes-couple-gets-married.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./twitch-voyboy-girlfriend-age-and-net-worth-why-is-voyboy-banned.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./twitch-voyboy-girlfriend-age-and-net-worth-why-is-voyboy-banned.html>Twitch: Voyboy Girlfriend Age, And Net Worth: Why Is Voyboy Banned?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./prince-william-cringes-about-2013-taylor-swift-jon-bon-jovi-collab.html>Prince William Cringes About 2013 Taylor Swift, Jon Bon Jovi Collab</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./prince-william-cringes-about-2013-taylor-swift-jon-bon-jovi-collab.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

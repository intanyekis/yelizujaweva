And while the&nbsp;successful celebrities on our list may have made it look so easy, the opposite side will prove just how rocky the road can be to fame. They may have found success at one point in time, but that might make the bitter reality of the years that followed all the harder to endure.

But did you know that it was one movie in particular that kept her in Hollywood? It was in 2005 when Adams was cast in the film, Junebug. While the film made under $4 million at the box office, Adams was recognized for her tremendous performance to the extent that she was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. While she lost out to Rachel Weisz and her performance in The Constant Gardener, the experience still taught Adams a lot about herself.</p><p>When talking about her mindset prior to the film coming out, Adams stated,</p><p><strong>"I thought maybe I should move to New York, maybe I should do something else. It wasn't that I was quitting or making a dramatic statement. It was more like maybe this just wasn't a good fit. Maybe I should go refocus. And then at Sundance, everything shifted."</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>What Adams was referring to was that at the Sundance festival she earned recognition in the category of Special Jury Prize for Acting. Some of Adams biggest standouts since then include Enchanted and Arrival. Not to mention playing Lois Lane in the Superman universe.</p><p>(Source: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">USAToday</a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wiki</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wiki for Best Supporting</a>)</p><h2 id=couldn-t-recover---rainn-wilson-with-the-office><strong>couldn't recover&nbsp;- Rainn Wilson&nbsp;With The Office</strong></h2><p>The Office&nbsp;should be commended as one of the best television series to ever air. And it definitely wouldn't have been that way if not for the tremendous acting of Rainn Wilson who portrays Dwight Schrute. But when you look at the career that Wilson has embarked on after leaving Dunder Mifflin, there sadly isn't too much that stands out.</p><p>This included a huge opportunity for Wilson when he starred in&nbsp;The Rocker&nbsp;back in 2008, but the results at the box office were nothing to write home about as it earned under $10 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Wilson's career is perhaps best now left to the world of voice-over acting, as he does have the role of Lex Luther in 2 upcoming animated Superman films, but that may not have been what he was hoping for. He also has a role in&nbsp;The Meg&nbsp;where Jason Statham is going after a 70-foot shark. Though that really seems like the type of mission where Dwight Schrute would be a very valuable asset to have. Ruby Rose is also one of the stars of the film. It&nbsp;might&nbsp;be good, but it may also very well be one of the worst movies of the year.

This includes playing an influential role in the X-Men universe in the role of Mystique. As well as, of course, also being given the leading role in The Hunger Games series which made her a household name.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But neither of those roles may have been put across the desk of Lawrence's agent if she hadn't absolutely brought her A-Game to Winter's Bone which came out in 2010. While Lawrence came up short to Natalie Portman's performance in Black Swan, she was still nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress. Plus, Portman absolutely rocked it in that role so it's not like there was any shame in having to lose to someone of her caliber.</p><p>And as we're sure you know, that was an award that she did end up winning in 2012 for her role in Silver Linings Playbook. Lawrence's last 3 movies have had shaky reviews, with Red Sparrow earning 47% on RottenTomatoes and Passengers gaining 30%. The sole bright spot was mother! which scored 69%.</p><p>Lawrence will be reprising her role as Mystique in 2019 for the film X-Men: Dark Phoenix. which at the very least, should be another huge box office hit for her.</p><p>(Source: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">IMDb</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">RottenTomatoes</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wiki</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wiki for Best Actress</a>)</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=couldn-t-recover---aaron-paul-with-breaking-bad><strong>couldn't recover&nbsp;- Aaron Paul With Breaking Bad</strong></h2><p>There aren't enough words to describe just how amazing Breaking Bad was,&nbsp;and Aaron Paul's dedication to the role of Jesse is remarkable. When talking about the role with EW, Paul revealed,</p><p><strong>"I would go home and spend time in very sketchy alleyways to scare myself. I wanted to know what that world was like … But a couple of years of just living in that character’s skin was a little much. I mean, I was having dreams as Jesse.”</strong></p><p>It would have been crazy to see what the tabloid headlines would have looked like if Paul had gotten himself seriously hurt while "method acting". When looking at where it all went wrong, the biggest knock in Paul's career came in 2014 when he appeared in 5 movies, none of which were positively reviewed by critics. This included Need For Speed, 22% on RottenTomatoes and Exodus: Gods and Kings which was marginally better received, scoring 28% but is definitely still no what he was looking for.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This was also the following year of&nbsp;Breaking Bad&nbsp;being off the year, meaning it was probably the most important year of determining the rest of his career.

This includes being cast as the villain in one of Dwayne Johnson's upcoming projects, Jungle Cruise, which is being produced by Disney. And if Dwayne Johnson's track record is anything to base your opinion off of, you can expect this will be another smash hit for Johnson and will make people even more aware of who Jesse Plemons is and what he's capable of. Though just in case Dwayne Johnson and Jesse Plemons weren't a strong enough sell, the always consistently brilliant Emily Blunt is also signed on for the project.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Plemons also found success on television in a variety of situations, including Friday Night Lights, that gave the public their first real look at Plemons. He also took on the role of the primary antagonist for the final season of Breaking Bad. But hey, somebody has to play the bad guy right?</p><p>In real life, Plemons is definitely a great guy though and is also awaiting the birth of his first child with his fiancee, Kirsten Dunst. The two met while working together (and playing love interests) on yet another tremendous show Plemons was apart of, Fargo.

And while the spin-off series,&nbsp;Girl Meets World,&nbsp;didn't fare as well as the original, it did still give Danielle Fishel the opportunity to play&nbsp;her iconic role of Topanga Lawrence again.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unfortunately for Fishel, if you were asked to list off other roles that she had done in her career, we may not be the only people who are left with our mind feeling blank.</p><p>Despite this, Fishel has still been upfront in the past about the positive impact that playing Topanga has had on her own life,</p><p><strong>"I think one of the things we learned from Topanga is how to be a strong woman. That was always one of my favorite things about her. She was a feminist and she was young and she was a little different and she was incredibly smart."</strong></p><p>Fishel also revealed the influence that Cory and Topanga's relationship has had on her life,</p><p>"I think some of the keys to making marriage last from Cory and Topanga's perspective is to always be on the same team."

Which is definitely understandable when you consider it has been Cuoco's "home" since 2007 and will be for the next few years. But if you're wondering why Kaley Cuoco was selected for one of the leading roles on the series, you can look back to a role on another television series - 8 Simple Rules For Dating My Teenage Daughter.</p><p>The series would have logically gone on for a longer run if not for the unexpected death of John Ritter who played the role of the father. When talking about working with the late great Ritter, Cuoco stated,</p><p><strong>“I just adored him. He’d put a potato chip on his shoulder and go, ‘Do I have a chip on my shoulder?’ And we would just crack up! He would do it every day! Working with him showed me that I loved sitcoms."</strong></p><p>Which means it also may not be a stretch to say that if Cuoco hadn't had such a tremendous experience on 8 Simple Rules that she would never have even thought about trying out for The Big Bang Theory.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>(Source: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">HuffingtonPost</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">IMDb</a>)</p><h2 id=couldn-t-recover---jake-lloyd-with-star-wars><strong>couldn't recover&nbsp;- Jake Lloyd With Star Wars</strong></h2><p>Jake Lloyd landed the role of a lifetime when he was cast as the young Anakin Skywalker in the&nbsp;Star Wars&nbsp;franchise.

Who outside of appearing in the film&nbsp;Madison&nbsp;that was filmed the following year, and came out 5 years later, retired from acting.</p><p>As Lloyd grew older, he stayed in the public eye but not for the right reasons. This includes&nbsp;a high speed car chase, where he definitely did not come out on the winning side of the race. When talking about his life and growing up with this behind him, he stated,</p><p><strong>"My entire school life was really a living hell — and I had to do up to 60 interviews a day."</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There are also many people out there who can't stand to watch&nbsp;Phantom Menace and Lloyd is also among them, "When you have something like that there's a lot of expectations for it to meet the standards of the public and I don't think George did that.&nbsp;For me to go back and watch it now would be kind of creepy."

Though his opinion of the film was definitely not positive when he was filming it,</p><p><strong>"Rowan (Atkinson) was funny, the rest of it was just awful and I had to be helped sobbing back onto the set. Then they had a screening in Santa Monica and suddenly everyone loved it. It was a total surprise to everyone," said Grant in an interview.</strong></p><p>Which is perhaps a reminder that he kept throughout his career for whenever he felt he was losing faith on a project. He also admitted that following the role, he had a ridiculous amount of movie offers that were coming his way.

This is perhaps best personified by the bombing of his 2011 film,&nbsp;Abduction.

But one of the added benefits that you do get towards the end, is the addition of Ellie Kemper's character, Kelly Erin Hannon, who joins the series in season 5.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kemper's character adds a tremendous amount of value to The Office, including several sweet moments shared with Steve Carell before his departure from the series. Kemper is one of the few stars from The Office who is still very much in the public eye thanks to her Netflix series, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, which started airing in 2015 and will be debuting its 4th season in May. And while the 3rd season dipped in terms of quality according to critics, in comparison to the 2nd, that drop was from 100% to 96%. Which means many seasons should be expected beyond the forth, provided Kemper is up for it.</p><p>Kemper has not won an Emmy for her performance, but it may only be a matter of time as she's been nominated on two separate occasions. While Kemper's success is primarily contained to these two projects, she's a tremendous example of a star who transitioned from one standout television show to another.

But when it comes to Elizabeth Berkley, it wasn't her role on wholesome television that led to the downfall of her career.</p><p>Instead, it was Showgirls, the movie that she put out in 1995 (3 years after Saved by The Bell). It was her first big step outside of the role of high school, and it was quite the step as Berkley appeared on the screen leaving nothing to the imagination.</p><p>Unfortunately, the film is also regarded as one of the worst to ever be made. This includes the Razzie's delving out 7 different awards for the film, including knocking Berkley's performance.

But when looking at what movie it was that helped push him into the public eye, you may have to give credit to The 40-Year-Old V*rgin.</p><p>While Steve Carell was the star of the series, Rogen still had many gut-busting sequences.

While most of his roles see him embracing the same style of character, including The 40-Year-Old Virgin, that may just make it all the more abundantly clear that it had the biggest role in his success. Rogen's most recent efforts was a Netflix special, Hilarity for Charity, which helps raise money towards helping Alzheimer's disease. It's a fundraiser that Rogen has been running since 2012, but got it's most public push this year because of Netflix's involvement.

In this case, it's the 2001 Disney film The Princess Diaries that ended up really showing her potential.</p><p>The film was a smash-hit at the box office, making over $150 million and led the way to several other prominent roles. This includes The Devil Wears Prada which made even more money and also helped out the career of Emily Blunt.</p><p>A sequel was eventually also made to The Princess Diaries that also earned over $100 million. Which perhaps makes the news that Julie Andrews (who also stars in the series) being up for a 3rd film not too surprising,</p><p><strong>"There’s talk about it. And [Anne]‘s very keen to do it.

Hathaway's career has definitely not been without its faults, including <i>Alice Through the Looking Glass </i>that scored 29% on RottenTomatoes, but that's definitely not going to slow down her career.

But sadly, it's also perhaps a constant reminder that Jennifer Grey was unable to turn the success of the film into anything else that ever came close to meeting those expectations.</p><p>ABC did do a made-for-TV version of the film, but Grey elected to not take on a role in the film again,</p><p><strong>"I was asked to do something on that show and I was flattered because I always want to be asked because it's nice to want to be included.

She mentions how the change didn't allow people to recognize her, and ultimately led to her regretting her decision.

This was also the first performance of Cameron Diaz's career.</p><p>After knocking it out of the park with those two efforts, Carrey finished the year off with Dumb and Dumber which grossed over $247 million. Something tells us he was able to buy himself a pretty nice Christmas present that year.</p><p>If Ace Ventura&nbsp;would have flopped though, which many people agree is Carrey in perhaps his most iconic state, the world would have been more than happy to pass over his follow-up efforts that year.

Perhaps the producers thought the God of Thunder would be able to sell more tickets?

The couple has seen its fair share of controversies.</p><p>The most significant controversy of their lovelife came from Kimbella cheating on Juelz. The controversy was revealed in <i>Love & Hip Hop: New York</i>. It is also considered one of the most scandalous moments in the show's history.</p><p>The controversy was about Kimbella sleeping with Fabolous. Fabolous was already in a long-term relationship with Emily Bustamente, who was also pregnant with his baby then. This led to all sorts of tension on the show, with Kimbella even getting in a physical altercation with Erica Mena.</p><h2>Married to Juelz Santana</h2><p>Kimbella Vanderhee has been married to <strong>Juelz Santana</strong> since <strong>2019</strong>. These two had one of Hollywood's most prolonged dating spells, as the pair dated for almost a decade before exchanging wedding vows.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/9/25/243353225_555112082378394_5602910764237584321_n%20(1)-1664101859932.jpg><p>Their fans were the happiest with the news. It's because their patience level had dried out thinking about whether the pair would marry.&nbsp;</p><h2>Why Kimbella's Husband Served Jail Time?</h2><p>The rocky relationship and rough times for Kimbella and Juelz did not exist until their marriage. The rock-bottom moment in their relationship was probably when Kimbella's husband was sentenced to jail.</p><p>It didn't happen long after their marriage. Juelz was arrested at the airport when it was found that he was carrying a 38 caliber handgun and oxycodone pills with him. Upon being found guilty of weapon charges, he was sentenced to a <strong>27-month</strong> sentence.</p><p>He did not serve his full jail time. He was released after spending <strong>19 months</strong> in jail.</p><h2>Born To Biracial Parents</h2><p>Kimbella's body is made up of mixed genes. Her father, <strong>Ottelie Vanderhee</strong>, is an African American, while her mother, <strong>Sherry Vanderhee</strong>, is caucasian and white.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/9/25/270272780_1634410423560799_1899798007075869576_n%20(1)-1664101245867.jpg><p>Unfortunately, she grew up in a violent household with her abusive father. But, she has forgiven him as they worked on their deteriorating relationship. Her parents are still together and going strong in their relationship.</p><h2>Blessed With Two Siblings</h2><p>Kimbella went through a lot of trouble and pain with her family as a young child. Her pain was eased to an extent by her siblings at the time.&nbsp;</p><p>She has a brother named <strong>Kenneth Vanderhee</strong>. Kenneth has also appeared in one episode of her sister's show <i>Love and Hip Hop: New York. </i>She also has a sister who works as a professional DJ. Her stage name is <strong>DJ Lil Kim</strong>.</p><h2>About Kimbella's&nbsp;Husband: Juelz Santana</h2><p>Juelz Santana is a very successful American rapper.

The controversial rapper was born on <strong>February 18, 1983</strong>.</p><h2>Education Background</h2><p>There is this common misconception among the general population that the people who work in reality television come from embarrassing educational backgrounds. Kimbella has undoubtedly managed to break those stereotypical beliefs.</p><p>She has shut those people's mouths by graduating with a Masters's Degree. She holds a Degree in Pharmacy. All of this was before she entered the modeling world. Upon being asked about this, she said she always liked the idea of working in front of the camera and hence, switched her career.</p><h2>Has Been Open About Her Surgeries</h2><p>Many people have preconceived notions about how models and television personalities should look. It is a controversial subject matter where people are divided. Some believe they shouldn't be judged, while others say that's why they get paid.</p><p>Celebrities, for this reason, don't readily reveal if they have done some surgeries. However, Kimbella doesn't fall into this category. She has been very open about her surgeries because she feels there shouldn't be any shame in hiding them.</p><figure class=media></figure><p>In the past, she has talked about her Brazilian Butt Lift Procedure.

Let's take a look at why she has fallen out of the spotlight.</p><h2 id=two-failed-reality-shows-and-movies>Two Failed Reality Shows... And Movies</h2><p>Lindsay Lohan has really fallen out of the public eye in the past few years, and while she tried to star on two reality shows, neither one worked out.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lindsay's OWN reality show failed</a>&nbsp;as she was always late for filming and even Oprah trying to give her a supportive and helpful pep talk didn't work out.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lindsay's movies haven't fared much better.&nbsp;Insider.com&nbsp;reported that Lindsay's 2007 film&nbsp;I Know Who Killed Me&nbsp;got a score of 9% on Rotten Tomatoes. She played Marilyn in&nbsp;InAPPropriate Comedy&nbsp;and according to&nbsp;Insider.com, it has a score of zero percent on Rotten Tomatoes.</p><p>The Canyons&nbsp;didn't get the best reviews either, earning a one-star review on&nbsp;Rogerebert.com. This is also the movie that made people realize that Lindsay Lohan might not be able to have a real comeback, as the&nbsp;New York Times&nbsp;wrote an article about her poor behavior on set.</p><p>Lindsay hasn't had any recent roles that really stand out as being memorable or something that would get people talking. She starred in the TV show&nbsp;Sick Note, which some might not have heard of, and was in one episode of&nbsp;2 Broke Girls&nbsp;in 2014. She hasn't had a starring role in a mainstream movie in a long time. If she was in a movie that did really well or had a cool new role on a TV show, it seems like people would hear about her much more often.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How Actress Lacey Chabert Lost Out On A $15 Million Job</a></span></p><h2 id=lindsay-in-2021>Lindsay In 2021</h2><p>What is Lindsay Lohan doing in 2021? Whenever people talk about it, the news is very random, and it doesn't add up to a cohesive career.</p><p>At the beginning of the year, a fan wanted to come out to her mom and dad and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wanted Lindsay to record a Cameo</a> to help her do so.</p><p>Lindsay said,&nbsp;<span class=s2>“Hi, Alana, it’s Lindsay Lohan. I know that you are about to take a very big step in telling your parents who you truly are and what you want them to accept of you — and I think you should do it yourself. I think that coming from you, you’ll feel a lot of power and strength. And it’s important that you are who you truly are, and that you love yourself and that you can live by that and tell your parents that.”</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to&nbsp;Variety, the TikTok then went viral, and then someone from the Cameo account asked Alana to remove the video.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="Here's What We Know About Lindsay Lohan And Her Strange Teeth" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's What We Know About Lindsay Lohan And Her Strange Teeth</a></span></p><p>Lindsay also talks about BitCoin, which seems strange and like it has come out of nowhere.</p><p>According to&nbsp;Forbes.com, Lindsay starred in a Cameo video talking about it, and she said that Bitcoin and&nbsp;ethereum would rise. She also&nbsp;wanted those watching the video to have&nbsp;"a prosperous 2021 and hoping you all get to drive your lambos to the moon."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lindsay was interviewed by&nbsp;Forbes&nbsp;and said that she thought that this would become a huge Hollywood trend. She explained,&nbsp;“It’s only a matter of time till everyone in Hollywood and beyond gets involved. Maybe we will see the tokenization of movies, and of how artists are paid for their films, music, and art. I see a future where crypto, NFTs, and blockchain will be the norm, rather than the exception.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="Lindsay Lohan Praised For Heartfelt Tribute To Late Natasha Richardson" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lindsay Lohan Praised For Heartfelt Tribute To Late Natasha Richardson</a></span></p><h2 id=living-in-dubai>Living In Dubai</h2><p>It sounds like Lindsay might like being out of the spotlight a little bit, as she has chosen&nbsp;to live in Dubai. According to&nbsp;Nicki Swift, Lindsay calls Dubai her home right now, and she said that she likes having female friendships there: she said,&nbsp;"It's a very big place for female activists. Women have a very strong community."</p><p>Lindsay also referred to living there as a "fresh start" and said that celebrity news isn't so big there, which she appreciates, and it does sound like she is happy living there.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As Lindsay said in an interview with&nbsp;W magazine,&nbsp;"I moved here for that purpose — I don't have to be publicly seen all the time, or discuss what I'm doing. There's a certain calmness that I find [in Dubai]. There's no paparazzi, no cameras; that's a big deal for me."</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="The Real Reason Hilary Duff And Lindsay Lohan Don’t Get Along" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Real Reason Hilary Duff And Lindsay Lohan Don’t Get Along</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHq4tNhmsKitXZm8r8CMoZyaql2Wr7DB02ajoqaUqK66ecuon5qmXZa7urnOq5xo</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fheres-why-you-dont-hear-about-lindsay-lohan-anymore.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fheres-why-you-dont-hear-about-lindsay-lohan-anymore.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fheres-why-you-dont-hear-about-lindsay-lohan-anymore.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fheres-why-you-dont-hear-about-lindsay-lohan-anymore.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fheres-why-you-dont-hear-about-lindsay-lohan-anymore.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fheres-why-you-dont-hear-about-lindsay-lohan-anymore.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./senator-tim-scott-wife.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./senator-tim-scott-wife.html>Senator Tim Scott Wife: How Did He Meet His Girlfriend in 2013?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./ethan-suplee.html>Ethan Suplee Biography, Age, Wife, Remember the Titans, Movies, Tv Shows And Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./ethan-suplee.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

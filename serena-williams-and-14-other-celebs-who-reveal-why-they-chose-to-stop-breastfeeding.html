Other times, you may not know what to do. But either way, you can’t just give up. Motherhood is a journey that you have to see through the end.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Every mother has her own struggle. And for celebrities, those struggles are often lived out in public. A child’s first year is especially challenging. At this age, a baby cannot communicate his or her needs. And it is also during this time that physicians recommend breastfeeding the child.</p><p>Breastfeeding helps keep a newborn nourished. It is also said to help strengthen the bond between mother and child. However, breastfeeding isn’t always a pleasant experience for mothers. As a result, some celebrity moms made the decision to stop breastfeeding. These include:</p><h2 id=serena-williams><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Serena Williams</span></h2><p>Tennis star Serena Williams decided to stop breastfeeding her daughter Olivia when she turned six months old. On the documentary “Being Serena,” Williams <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">explained</a>, “Once I got to six months I felt good about it. Then it was just emotionally letting go. I literally sat Olympia in my arms, I talked to her, we prayed about it. I told her, ‘Look, I’m going to stop. Mommy has to do this.’ I cried a little bit, not as much as I thought I was. She was fine.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=emily-maynard-johnson><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Emily Maynard Johnson</span></h2><p>Former ‘Bachelorette’ star Emily Maynard Johnson is now a mother of four children. And by the time she gave birth to her third child Gibson, she was having breastfeeding issues. She told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>, “I just quit. I didn’t want to tell anybody that I quit. I was trying to hide formula. I saw all of these beautiful breastfeeding pictures, I don’t know if I would post a picture like that, but I would love the option. I wanted to so bad.”</p><h2 id=khloe-kardashian><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Khloe Kardashian</span></h2><p>In April 2018, Khloe Kardashian gave birth to daughter True Thompson and later that year, she revealed that she stopped breastfeeding her daughter. On Twitter, the reality star <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">revealed</a>, “I had to stop breast feeding it was really hard for me to stop (emotionally) but it wasn’t working for my body. Sadly.” She also later tweeted, “It was so frustrating because for Kourt it was sooooooo easy for her to breast feed. My experience was very different.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Khloe Kardashian Reveals Her Workout Playlist And Her Intense Routine</a></span></p><h2 id=kim-kardashian><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Kim Kardashian</span></h2><p>While making an appearance on “Live! With Kelly and Ryan,” Kim Kardashian talked about her decision not to breastfeed Chicago. The reality star <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">explained</a>, “I enjoy carrying myself, [but] that wasn't an option for me for my last child and moving forward, so I will say, when it came time to the breastfeeding time, I was like, 'OK. This is the best decision I ever made.' It is a game changer.” Kardashian added, “Not having to go through that every few hours breastfeeding. Not having to go through that every few hours breastfeeding.”</p><h2 id=coco-rocha><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Coco Rocha</span></h2><p>After being criticized for switching to formula feeding, model Coco Rocha took to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a>&nbsp;and explained, “Not that this is anyone's business - I loved breastfeeding Ioni for the first 5 months of her life and then one day my milk went dry. It happens to every mom at different times. She's been on formula for a few weeks now and seems to be doing just fine.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kelly-rowland><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Kelly Rowland</span></h2><p>During an interview with Parents Magazine, Kelly Rowland talked about the challenges of breastfeeding her son, Titan. Rowland <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">recalled</a>, “I had my heart set on breastfeeding, but I wasn’t producing enough milk.

Initially, she tried to nurse her daughter, Jolie Rae. However, she didn’t really want to. Kramer <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">explained</a>, “I had no desire. I wasn’t breastfed. I didn’t feel like I had to have that connection with my baby. Personally, I don’t like my nipples being touched. I don’t like it. I don’t want someone sucking on ’em.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jamie-lynn-sigler><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Jamie Lynn Sigler</span></h2><p>The former “Entourage” actress is suffering from MS and this affected her decision to stop breastfeeding. Taking to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a>, Sigler explained, “I’m having to stop breastfeeding soon so I can get back on meds. The truth is, the toll of two kids and a newborn lifestyle is not the easiest on me.. and I need some help. What sucks is that I live with a disease that makes decisions for me a lot , and with breastfeeding I took SUCH pride that I was able to do something really awesome with this body that I am constantly at war with.”</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bhad Bhabie Back On Instagram To Defend Her Mother</a></span></p><h2 id=elisa-donovan><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Elisa Donovan</span></h2><p>The ‘Clueless’ got real about breastfeeding in a blog entry for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>. In her entry, Donovan recalled, “This process took almost an hour in its entirety, was painful beyond words, and only yielded the tiniest amount of milk. Scarlett was feeding every 2-3 hours, so this was a 24 hour-a-day endeavor. After five more days of this with no improvement, I finally had to consider that maybe breastfeeding was not for me.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jillian-harris><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Jillian Harris</span></h2><p>The HGTV host revealed that she had to stop nursing her first born when he was five months old.

Now the baby is crying!”</p><h2 id=adele><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Adele</span></h2><p>Adele once spoke out about the pressure that new moms feel about being able to breastfeed. And then, she also offered some advice, saying, “Breastfeed if you can but don't worry, Aptamil [formula]'s just as good. I mean, I loved it, all I wanted to do was breastfeed and then I couldn't and then I felt like, 'if I was in the jungle now back in the day, my kid would be dead because my milk's gone.' It's not funny that's how some of us think.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Little-Known Facts About Adele’s Rise To Fame</a></span></p><h2 id=molly-sims><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Molly Sims</span></h2><p>While speaking with host Anderson Cooper on “Anderson Live,” Molly Sims said she breastfed her baby until she couldn’t physically handle the pain anymore.

Celebrity friendships are always entertaining as we get to see who's friends with who exactly, and there's always that one surprising friendship that we don't expect. Recently, fans have been obsessed with the friendship between <strong>Olivia Rodrigo</strong> and <strong>Taylor Swift</strong>, and we don't blame them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Fans React To Olivia Rodrigo And Taylor Swift Meeting At The Brits!</a></span></p><p>This friendship is a dream come true, especially for Olivia, who has been a fan of Taylor for the longest time. Now that her career has taken off, Taylor has taken her under her wing, teaching her the dos and don'ts of being famous in the music industry. Together, they're a super-powerful singing and songwriting duo, and we can only hope to see their friendship blossom, and maybe a duet in the future.</p><h2 id=olivia-was-taylor-s-biggest-fan><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Olivia Was Taylor's Biggest Fan</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Back before <a href=#>Olivia Rodrigo</a> became a famous pop star in her own right, she considered herself a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Swiftie</a> as she is one of Taylor Swift's biggest fans. In fact, Olivia compares herself to Taylor and says she learned everything she knows from her. When it comes to songwriting, Olivia credits Taylor as being her biggest inspiration. She's been a fan from the very beginning and definitely believes that Taylor has had a huge influence on her music. If you listen hard enough you can hear the similarities between the two, and hear that Taylor Swift influence.</p><h2 id=olivia-covered-taylor><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Olivia&nbsp;Covered Taylor</span></h2><p>Before <a href=#>Olivia</a> became the superstar she is today, she shared a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">cover</a> of Taylor's hit song "Cruel Summer." It got many fans buzzing, especially the Swifties as they really enjoyed Olivia's take on Taylor's song. That wasn't all â€” she even got the attention of Taylor herself. Taylor shared Oliva's cover on her social media with the comment, "THE TALENT. Love this!!!" Olivia, being a huge Swiftie herself, screenshot Taylor's post with her own caption, "I AM GONNA FRAM THIS SCREENSHOT AND HANG IT ABOVE MY FIRSTBORN'S CRIB."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=olivia-followed-in-taylor-s-footsteps><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Olivia Followed In Taylor's Footsteps</span></h2><p>Taking another page out of her idol Taylor's book, <a href=#>Olivia</a> pretty much followed in Taylor's footsteps. After releasing her song "Drivers License," the song was an instant hit. It took off all over social media and on the radio, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she saw success</a> rather quickly. In fact, Olivia couldn't even believe the success herself, and it finally hit her when she saw her own song on the iTunes chart underneath Taylor's.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Taylor Swift Sends Unreleased Song To Olivia Rodrigo & Conan Gray Who Reply On TikTok</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, being a huge fan of Taylor, Olivia had the best reaction to seeing that. She posted a screenshot of the chart on social media, writing "Next to Taylor on the U.S. iTunes chart I'm in a puddle of tears!" That had to be the point which Olivia finally realized that she was making it big, and was following in the footsteps of her very own idol.</p><h2 id=taylor-applauded-olivia-on-social-media><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Taylor Applauded Olivia On Social Media</span></h2><p>As if that wasn't enough for <a href=#>Olivia</a>, she received the best blessing from Taylor swift, and from then on out her career and their friendship was history. Once Olivia posted about her song "Drivers License" being at No. 3 on the iTunes chart under Taylor, she had to chime in too. In fact, Taylor commented on Olivia's post saying "I say that's my baby and I'm really proud." With <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Taylor's seal of approval</a>, "Drivers License" went straight to No. 1.&nbsp;You cannot deny that Taylor Swift has influence over music, especially when her comments about Olivia helped get the song to the top of the charts.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=taylor-sent-olivia-personal-gifts><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Taylor Sent Olivia Personal Gifts</span></h2><p>Taylor and <a href=#>Olivia</a> became even closer friends when Taylor sent her a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">package of gifts</a>. Olivia revealed that the package included a very personal and handwritten note from Taylor along with a few other gifts. She shared that Taylor had given her a ring that was similar to one that Taylor wore when she wrote Red and Taylor wanted Olivia to have one just like it since it also meant so much to her. The package only ensured Olivia's love for her idol even more, as she was thankful to be born during a time where she could look up to Taylor as both an artist as well as a person.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-finally-met-in-may><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>They Finally Met In May</span></h2><p>After all of the back and forth on social media, and <a href=#>Olivia</a> sharing her love for Taylor Swift, it was hard to believe&nbsp;that the two never met in person before. Fans were excited for Olivia to meet Taylor at some point, and it was all they could talk about for a while. The opportunity for the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">two to meet</a> finally came during the 2021 Brit Awards.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Taylor Swift Gifts Olivia Rodrigo With This Sweet Personal Item Of Hers</a></span></p><p>It was a busy night for both as Olivia performed and Taylor took home a few awards, but they still made some time to meet for the first time in person. Fans went absolutely insane when Olivia shared a photo of herself and Taylor on Instagram, sharing that they finally got to meet in person. You can definitely tell how happy she was to finally meet her idol, despite the fact that Olivia is just as famous as Taylor at this point.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=olivia-sampled-taylor-on-her-album><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Olivia Sampled Taylor On Her Album</span></h2><p>If you pay close attention, you might notice that one of <a href=#>Olivia's</a> songs sounds awfully familiar to Taylor's. Of off her debut album&nbsp;Sour, Olivia's song "1 Step Forward, 3 Steps Back" sounds similar to Taylor's song "New Year's Day." That's because Olivia <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">samples</a> the track by using the same piano melody. In technical terms, Olivia's song interpolates Taylor's which means that she borrowed musical elements. Not only has Olivia cited Taylor as an influence on her and her music, but she actually used her in her music.</p><h2 id=olivia-gave-taylor-credit-on-her-album><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Olivia Gave Taylor Credit On Her Album</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Now that we know that <a href=#>Olivia</a> samples Taylor on her track "1 Step Forward, 3 Steps Back," it kind of makes sense why she would give Taylor <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">writing credits</a> on&nbsp;Sour. On top of that, she also credited Jack Antonoff as well. Jack is the longtime producer of Taylor and has contributed to most of her recent music. Even though the two never actually wrote on the album, because she sampled their work and cited Taylor as one of her major influences, she decided that she would give them credit on her debut album.</p><h2 id=olivia-got-to-hear-fearless-taylor-s-version-first><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Olivia Got To Hear 'Fearless (Taylor's Version)' First</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We all know that Taylor has been re-releasing her music as she has re-recorded them&nbsp;since she lost ownership of all of her masters, and <a href=#>Olivia</a>, being the superfan that she is, was able to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">listen to the new versions first</a>, thanks to her friendship with Taylor. Before Taylor re-released&nbsp;Fearless, she let Olivia get one of the first listened. She shared a video of herself along with Conan Gray dancing and singing to "White Horse (Taylor's Version)." Being one of Taylor's close friends and one of her biggest fans really works out in the end.</p><h2 id=olivia-has-taken-notes-from-taylor><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Olivia Has Taken Notes From Taylor</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since her sudden rise to fame, <a href=#>Olivia</a> has taken a lot of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">notes</a> from Taylor. One of the things that Taylor is known for is hiding clues and other Easter Eggs to get her fans trying to figure things out and connect the dots. It seems like Olivia is doing the same thing. Taylor's favorite number is 13, and tends to do a lot of things that add up to that number. On April 13 Olivia announced her debut album, and that the release date would be May 21, and 5/21/2021 adds up to be 13. She also has the song "1 Step Forward, 3 Steps Back" in which the numbers are also 13. We're not 100% certain if she was trying to do that, but it seems awfully coincidental!</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>Fans Compare Olivia Rodrigoâ€™s â€˜Good 4 Uâ€™ Music Video With This Megan Fox Movie</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dpLmqwsiaZKunlKe2qLuMmqWdZaSWxq270WaqsKGWqXqjscKapJ5llqe2prrDrGY%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhow-olivia-rodrigo-and-taylor-swift-became-friends.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fhow-olivia-rodrigo-and-taylor-swift-became-friends.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fhow-olivia-rodrigo-and-taylor-swift-became-friends.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fhow-olivia-rodrigo-and-taylor-swift-became-friends.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhow-olivia-rodrigo-and-taylor-swift-became-friends.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhow-olivia-rodrigo-and-taylor-swift-became-friends.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./jason-gould-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./jason-gould-net-worth.html>Jason Gould Net Worth - Pulptastic</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./james-o-halloran-actor.html>Fame | James O'Halloran (actor) net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./james-o-halloran-actor.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

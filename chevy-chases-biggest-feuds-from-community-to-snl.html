And if anybody deserved to be slapped in the forehead it was John, for instigating it all.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Chase was a major player on “Saturday Night Live” from 1975 to 1976. <span class=credit>©NBC/Courtesy Everett Collection</span></figure><p>On another occasion, while making a guest appearance on the show in 1985, Chase got on Robert Downey Jr.’s nerves by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">taking a swipe </a>at his late father.</p><p>The Emmy winner allegedly told the “Iron Man” star: “Didn’t your father used to be a successful director? Whatever happened to him? Boy, he sure died, you know, he sure went to hell.”</p><p>Years later in 2018, he made a highly publicized dig at the sketch comedy series in an interview with the Washington Post.</p><p>“I had to watch a little of it, and I just couldn’t f–king believe it,” Chase said regarding the updated version of the show. “That means a whole generation of s–theads laughs at the worst f–king humor in the world. You know what I mean? How could you dare give that generation worse s–t than they already have in their lives? It just drives me nuts.”</p><p>Pete Davidson, who was a cast member on “SNL” at the time, didn’t mince his words in response while appearing on Howard Stern’s&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">SiriusXM show</a>.</p><p>“He’s a f–king douchebag. F–k Chevy Chase. I hate that dude,” Davidson&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">told Stern</a>&nbsp;in response to the interview. “He’s just a genuinely bad, racist person, and I don’t like him.” Davidson also defended “SNL” creator&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Lorne Michaels</a>, saying Chase’s words were “disrespectful to a guy who gave you a career” and that “no matter how big you get, you can’t forget what that guy did for you.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>“Community”</h2><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Danny Pudi (left), Chase, Joel McHaler, Yvette Nicole Brown, Donald Glover, Alison Brie and Gillian Jacobs in “Community.” <span class=credit>NBCU Photo Bank/NBCUniversal via Getty Images</span></figure><p>In 2009, Chase landed the starring role on NBC’s sitcom, “Community,” portraying millionaire Pierce Hawthorne for five seasons.</p><p>While the show was a step in the right direction for his career, his on-set behavior created drama with castmates.</p><p>One major incident from the show pertained to allegations of racist actions toward co-stars.</p><p>Chase was fired from the show in 2013 after allegedly <a href=#>using a racist slur</a> toward Donald Glover during filming and following<a href=#>&nbsp;a heated confrontation</a>&nbsp;with its creator, Dan Harmon.</p><p>Glover, 40, claimed that Chase<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;used the N-word</a> while on a rant about his issues with his character.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Chase portrayed millionaire Pierce Hawthorne on the series. <span class=credit>©NBC/Courtesy Everett Collection</span></figure><p>He reportedly used the phrase when he was confused about the dialogue in a scene with the “This Is America” singer and star Yvette Nicole Brown.</p><p>In 2018, the “Atlanta” actor and Harmon opened up to the<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;New Yorker</a>&nbsp;about Chase’s inappropriate conduct.</p><p>“Chevy was the first to realize how immensely gifted Donald was, and the way he expressed his jealousy was to try to throw Donald off,”&nbsp;Harmon said at the time. “I remember apologizing to Donald after a particularly rough night of Chevy’s non-PC verbiage, and Donald said, ‘I don’t even worry about it.’”</p><p>Glover chimed in: “I just saw Chevy as fighting time — a true artist has to be OK with his reign being over. I can’t help him if he’s thrashing in the water. But I know there’s a human in there somewhere — he’s almost too human.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Glover (right) claimed that Chase called him a racist slur on “Community.”</figure><p>The “Hot Tub Time Machine” star didn’t deny using the racist insult during an&nbsp;interview with the <a href=#>Washington Post&nbsp;</a>later that same year.&nbsp;</p><p>“I could have said it,” he told the publication, before noting it would have been misinterpreted. He then added that he had been a fan of Glover’s the entire time they worked together on “Community” and denied that he was a bigot.</p><p>Chase recently expressed his hatred of the show, telling Marc Maron on his&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“WTF”&nbsp;podcast</a>&nbsp;that “Community” <a href=#>wasn’t “funny enough” for him</a>.</p><p>“I felt a little bit constrained a bit. Everyone had their bits and stuff. I thought they were all good, but it just wasn’t hard-hitting enough for me,” he said.</p><p><a href=#>The “Community” cast is set to reunite for a movie,</a> but it’s unlikely that Chase will be a part of the project.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3Jma29fmLWmwthmmqGZo5rAbq7IoJ6eq6Ris6bBw6xkn6qfonqku8ymrKehpK56tbuMrKWlZw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fchevy-chases-biggest-feuds-from-community-to-snl.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fchevy-chases-biggest-feuds-from-community-to-snl.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fchevy-chases-biggest-feuds-from-community-to-snl.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fchevy-chases-biggest-feuds-from-community-to-snl.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fchevy-chases-biggest-feuds-from-community-to-snl.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fchevy-chases-biggest-feuds-from-community-to-snl.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./benzino-daughter-coi-leray-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./benzino-daughter-coi-leray-html.html>Inside Benzinos Beef with His Daughter Coi Leray</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./kristin-cavallari-feat-clothing-collaboration-athleisure-sweats.html>Kristin Cavallari Just Launched an Athleisure Collection With Feat Clothing Shop Now</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./kristin-cavallari-feat-clothing-collaboration-athleisure-sweats.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

For example, there was a lot of interest in the film's incredible cast.Over the last couple of decades, Independence Day's talented cast starred in a lot of other projects. With that in mind, it begs two questions, how much money were Independence Day's stars paid for those roles, and how much are they worth now?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-is-randy-quaid-s-net-worth><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>What Is Randy Quaid's Net Worth?</span></h2><p>When Independence Day was released, many people loved Randy Quaid's character, Russell Casse, an eccentric pilot who claimed to have previously been abducted by aliens. After that, Quaid went on to star in several films like Kingpin and Vegas Vacation.</p><p>Sadly, however, Quaid hasn't enjoyed the same success that many of his Independence Day co-stars have. Instead, Quaid is the exception to the rule since <a href=#>he has gone broke</a> even though he previously starred in so many hit movies.</p><p>After engaging in some troubling behavior, Quaid has repeatedly gotten in trouble with the law. On top of that, Quaid's behavior is so offputting that nobody in the business wants to work with him any longer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to celebritynetworth.com, Quaid's finances are so bad that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he is $1 million in debt</a> as of this writing.</p><h2 id=what-is-vivica-a-fox-s-net-worth><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>What Is Vivica A.

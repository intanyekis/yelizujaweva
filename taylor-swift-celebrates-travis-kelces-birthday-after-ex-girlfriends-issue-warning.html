She arrived a day before the NFL star’s 34th birthday.

They dated on and off from 2017 to 2022, and faced allegations of infidelity during their time together. The 31-year old recently <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">released a letter on Instagram addressing the online hate</a> she’s received since her ex started his very public romance with Taylor.</p><p>Kayla didn’t address Taylor or Travis by name, nor did she share details of her past relationship with the NFL player, but she did imply that their romance was hurtful.</p><p>"My truth, trauma, and vulnerability are a relatable part of the human experience. I know I’m not alone and I want to make sure you know that you’re not either,” she wrote. “On days when I feel most inadequate, I have to remind myself that I am, have been, and will always be more than enough.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/taylor-swift-s-most-quotable-lyrics-ranked-1-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Taylor Swift's Most Quotable Lyrics Ranked, According To Reddit</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Since the start of her career with Tim McGraw, and now with her 'Taylor's Version' albums, Swift has had some of the most quotable song lyrics.</span><p>Perhaps even more telling, Travis’ other <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ex-girlfriend Maya Benberry spoke to Daily Mail </a>where she had a very clear message for Taylor, and wasn’t afraid to paint her ex in a poor light. “Taylor seems like such a fun girl with a beautiful spirit so I wish her the best of luck but I wouldn’t be a girls' girl if I didn’t advise her to be smart!” Maya said.</p><p>She began dating Travis in 2016 after winning the reality competition Catching Kelce, but she says things ended when she learned he was dating Kayla Cook at the same time.</p><p>“I’m sure by now she has mastered the ability to see who is really there for her -

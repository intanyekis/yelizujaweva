For example, when there were only rumors about Swift and Kelce, fans were dying for some kind of confirmation that they were a couple.</p><p>In May 2024, fans do not doubt that Swift and Kelce are a couple. As a result, many of them want the duo to take the next step by getting engaged. In fact, even people who aren't traditional <strong>Swifties are</strong><strong>putting Kelce under pressure to propose to Swift</strong> in their own way.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ttweb_how-travis-kelce-s-net-worth-is-being-affected-by-his-taylor-swift-romance_bk_a1_v3.jpg><p>Of all people, Dave Portnoy from Barstool Sports arguably is putting Kelce under pressure to propose to Swift.

However, Portnoy's prediction added yet another voice to the online conjecture that Kelce would propose to Swift soon.</p><p>Many people can attest that being pestered about getting married soon can create a lot of pressure that quickly builds up and can lead to a proposal.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/fans-noticed-an-icy-rift-between-travis-kelce-s-brother-jason-and-taylor-swift-here-s-the-truth-about-their-relationship_-front-right-_deposit-left-instar.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Fans Noticed An Icy Rift Between Travis Kelce's Brother Jason And Taylor Swift, Here's The Truth About Their Relationship</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Many Taylor Swift want to know about her relationship with Travis Kelce's Brother Jason and his wife Kylie.</span><p>Also in May 2024, a report from Life & Style indicated that Kelce may be under a lot of pressure to propose to Swift. According to an insider who spoke to the outlet, it was believed that Swift and Kelce were very happy, so there<strong> <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">had likely been a lot of talk about marriage</a></strong>.</p><p>“The timing is right. They’ve been together almost a year now and they’re madly in love, so it makes sense that they’d be discussing marriage.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/taylor-swift-in-pink-travis-kelce.jpg><p>The same source went on to tell Life & Style that <strong>when Kelce proposes, he needs to go big</strong>.

In fact, Swift's Eras tour concert tickets were in such high demand that the presale resulted in a United States Senate hearing.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><span>2:01</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/travis-kelce-made-a-lifestyle-adjustment-to-deal-with-taylor-swift-s-cats-left-deposit-back-taylor-swift-ig-right-deposit.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Travis Kelce Made A Lifestyle Adjustment To Deal With Taylor Swift's Cats</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Taylor Swift's well-known love for cats appears to be changing the life of her much-talked-about boyfriend Travis Kelce.</span><p>Given how passionate Swift's fans are about her, every concert that is a part of her Eras tour has garnered a lot of attention. That fact has meant that many of Swift's fans have learned about the small ways that she made any of her concerts on the tour different.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Then, in May 2024, Swift made so many notable changes to the format of her Eras tour concerts that even many of her casual fans found out. According to a May 2024 article from Teen Vogue, <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the Eras tour underwent a sweeping list of changes</a></strong> as it made its way to Europe.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/1-5.jpg><p>While it may have surprised some observers to see that Swift's Eras tour change so much part way through, it actually makes perfect sense. After all, Teen Vogue's article explained that the show was changed to incorporate songs from Swfit's April 2024 album "The Tortured Poets Department".</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For many rock bands, adding several new songs to a concert wouldn't necessitate that much work. For example, if Metallica decides to add songs they haven't played in years to a concert, they have to brush up on the tracks and maybe change some of the onscreen visuals.</p><p>In Swift's case, however, it seems pretty clear that adding songs from "The Tortured Poets Department" has caused her to <strong>revamp her concerts in many ways</strong>.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><span>2:03</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/taylor-swift-s-parents-may-live-a-life-of-luxury-despite-false-claims-about-their-abandoned-tiktok-mansion-front-deposit-back-instar.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Taylor Swift's Parents May Live A Life Of Luxury Despite False Claims About Their Abandoned TikTok Mansion</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>What is the truth about how Taylor Swift's parents live following rumors about their mansion?</span><p>According to Teen Vogue's reporting, <strong>Swift has added new songs to her playlist and reordered many of the tracks</strong> she performed during earlier stops. Swift has also learned new dance moves and donned new costumes that match the songs she has added to her playlist.</p><p>Unfortunately, to make room for "The Tortured Poets Department", Swift had to condense parts of her earlier concerts. For example, Swift left songs like "The Archer!”, “Long Live”, “'Tis the Damn Season”, and “Tolerate It” out of her concerts. Swift also reportedly condensed the "Folklore" and "Evermore" sections of her earlier concerts into one.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/here-s-why-even-taylor-swift-s-eras-tour-backup-dancers-made-a-massive-amount-of-money-front-deposit-back-commons-licences.jpg><p>According to Screen Rant, fans were <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">especially disappointed that "Long Live" was cut from Swift's Eras tour playlist</a></strong>. This is because there was previously so much excitement that "Long Live" was part of the Disney+ movie version of The Eras tour since fans feared it was going to be cut.</p><p>According to a March 2024 article from Variety, the film version of Taylor Swift's Eras tour broke records on Disney+. The outlet reported that the film had 4.6 million views on Disney+ in just three days. That figure made the movie the most streamed music film in the history of Disney+.</p><p>Given all the changes Swift made to the Eras tour in May 2024, maybe it would make sense if Travis Kelce didn't propose, at least until things calm down.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirq5mmnsBut8Slmp5lpJbGrbvRZqqwoZaperG%2BzqmmrJmcYrKzrdJmq6itomKwqa3NoJysZw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftravis-kelce-taylor-swift-proposal-eras-tour-changes.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ftravis-kelce-taylor-swift-proposal-eras-tour-changes.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ftravis-kelce-taylor-swift-proposal-eras-tour-changes.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ftravis-kelce-taylor-swift-proposal-eras-tour-changes.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftravis-kelce-taylor-swift-proposal-eras-tour-changes.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftravis-kelce-taylor-swift-proposal-eras-tour-changes.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./taylor-swift-new-song-tortured-poets-department-cpr.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./taylor-swift-new-song-tortured-poets-department-cpr.html>Taylor Swift's New Song From Tortured Poets Department Can Literally Save Lives</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./net-worth.html>Mdchen Amick Net Worth How Much is Amick Worth?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

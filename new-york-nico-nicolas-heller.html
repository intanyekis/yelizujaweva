Nico has supported countless independent businesses through his social media campaigns which have earned stores hundreds of followers, and even more important, new customers. During the pandemic, New York Nico <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">hit new strides</a> and made efforts to secure funding for mom n pop shops in need. He <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">created revenue streams</a> and highlighted some of New York’s oldest establishments, making sure that nothing, not even a global pandemic, could cause them to shut their doors.

In addition to a wide range of locals who competed for the spot, the competition also attracted entrances from some of New York’s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">top celebrities</a> including Alec Baldwin, Wayne Diamond and rapper Princess Nokia. Winner of the competition was New York Nico favorite and consistent collaborator <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Charles Salerno</a>, better known as CharliDaWolf.
